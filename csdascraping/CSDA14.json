These commercial smallsat data may provide a cost-effective way to augment or complement the suite of Earth observations acquired by NASA, other U.S. Government agencies, and international partners. ESD recognizes the potential impact commercial small-satellite (smallsat) constellations may have in encouraging/enabling efficient approaches to advancing Earth System Science and applications development for societal benefit. The CSDA Program was initiated in 2017 with the Private-Sector Small Constellation Satellite Data Product Pilot Project . Strategic Objectives NASA’s ESD will continuously monitor the commercial smallsat industry and acquire relevant data to complement NASA's Earth observation data. Data that are favorably evaluated and deemed of sufficient value will be purchased by NASA for broader sustained use. To facilitate standard scientific collaborations, NASA will seek end-user license agreements (EULAs) to enable broad levels of dissemination and shareability of the commercial data with U.S. Government agencies and partners. NASA will maintain an archive of the data acquired from the vendors. Establish continuous and repeatable processes to on-ramp new commercial data vendors and evaluate data for their potential to advance NASA’s Earth science research and applications activities. Ensure long-term data preservation through the establishment of data management processes and systems to support rapid evaluation, access, and distribution of purchased data and long-term access for scientific reproducibility. Enable the sustained use of purchased data for broader use and dissemination by the Earth scientific community. Coordinate with other U.S. Government agencies and international partners on the evaluation and scientific use of commercial data. The scientific community may use commercial datasets that are acquired by NASA for scientific purposes in adherence to vendor-specific terms and conditions. All data requests must be approved by CSDA via submitting the authorization request form . Once verified, the user will be provided with additional information on how to request and access data. Current information about vendors, user licenses, and available data can be found in the vendor section below. As additional commercial small satellite datasets are evaluated and acquired, those datasets will also be made available.

Credit: DEM(s) created by the Polar Geospatial Center from Maxar imagery Vendor On-ramp and Evaluation NASA’s ESD has established a formal process for identifying commercial smallsat vendors for on-ramp and evaluation. This process involves Request For Proposals (RFPs) followed by an independent NASA evaluation of selected commercial data products. As necessary, NASA ESD will perform market research to assess the development of Earth science commercial data products and market growth across the industry. If warranted, RFPs will be issued to on-ramp additional vendors as the industry emerges with new candidates and capabilities. Vendors meeting the minimum qualifications could submit a RFP so that NASA can evaluate the data to determine their suitability for advancing NASA’s science and application goals. All RFPs and contracts contain standardized scientific use EULAs to avoid confusion for users about how the data can be used. The CSDA Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) was posted September 27, 2022. Evaluation Data products from selected vendors are evaluated by teams of principal investigators (PIs) selected by the ESD. Evaluation criteria include: Accessibility of data Completeness and accuracy of metadata User support services provided by the commercial entity Usefulness of submitted data for science and applications The evaluation results are summarized and distributed to ESD senior management. NASA uses the summary evaluation report, individual PI reports, and other information to determine the suitability of data from each vendor for future procurement. More details on the data evaluations are available on the Smallsat Data Evaluation page. All data purchased during the evaluation phase are preserved for long-term use by the scientific community in accordance with the EULA.

What is CMR? NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR) is a high-performance, high-quality, continuously evolving metadata system that catalogs all data and service metadata records for NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) system and will be the authoritative management system for all EOSDIS metadata. These metadata records are registered, modified, discovered, and accessed through programmatic interfaces leveraging standard protocols and APIs. CMR tools and services include: CMR Application Metadata Management Tool ( MMT ) draft Metadata Management Tool ( dMMT ) Metadata Curation Dashboard CMR is the backend behind the following data search and discovery services: Earthdata Search International Data Network ( IDN ) How does CMR do that? CMR is designed to handle metadata at the concept level. Collections and granules are common metadata concepts, but this can be extended out to visualizations, variables, documentation, services, and more. CMR provides a flexible ingest system with metadata libraries which can handle multiple metadata record formats, multiple metadata record concepts, and relationships and validations between them. As new formats are introduced, new translations can be written for CMR’s metadata libraries to provide ingest, validation and search support. The libraries also provide format conversions for backward compatibility. Image Back to top Why CMR? NASA's Earth Science Data Information System ( ESDIS ) Project is responsible for providing access to Earth Observation data and services to an ever-growing user community including—but not limited to—Earth scientists, educators, other government agencies, decision makers, and the general public. As data archives grow and more data becomes accessible online—cataloging, searching, and extracting relevant data from these archives becomes a critical part of Earth science research. Formerly, NASA metadata providers were required to contend with multiple, disparate systems; each requiring different formats and different mechanisms for submitting and updating data entries. As an end user or application developer, this inconsistency reduced the value of the metadata and complicated finding and using earth science data. In response to these challenges, NASA set out to design a system that would reduce the burden on metadata providers and improve the metadata quality, consistency, and usability for end users by: Handling metadata at the concept level; including collections, granules, visualizations, variables, documentation, services, and more. Managing hundreds of millions of metadata records; making them available through performing standards-based temporal, spatial, and faceted search. Incorporating both human and machine metadata assessment features that work to ensure the highest quality metadata possible. Supporting multiple metadata standards using an ever-evolving Unified Metadata Model ( UMM ). Back to top Benefits of CMR Unified Repository CMR provides a unified repository for NASA's Earth science metadata. This benefits providers by only needing to ingest their metadata into one system. It also benefits users by being able search one system and retrieve both EOSDIS and IDN data. Enhanced Performance Modern Earth science applications strive to provide end users with nearly immediate access and interactivity across massive stores of Earth science data. That data is discovered, navigated, and often interrogated through science metadata. As the range of applications grow and more and more information moves from the underlying science data to metadata, the challenges of navigating even just the metadata increases. CMR is designed to handle hundreds of millions of metadata records; striving to make them available in under a second. CMR is able to do this by a using sophisticated data indexing and caching strategies built on top of a performance infrastructure. Quality Assurance High performance access to metadata is only part of the problem. To be useful to a broad range of Earth science applications, the metadata must be of high quality, complete, and consistent. CMR incorporates both human and machine metadata assessment features that work to ensure the highest quality metadata possible. During ingest, automated metadata scoring rubrics are applied giving data providers insight into how to make their data more discoverable or usable by end users. Science coordinators and review teams can review metadata that fails verification or lacks required information to help providers make their metadata more consistent and complete. Consistent Metadata Representation CMR's ingest framework supports services which validate distinct metadata standards such as ECHO10, IDN DIF, and ISO19115 against a common set of core metadata elements described in UMM. UMM describes the metadata related to key EOSDIS concepts (such as collection or granule) using UMM metadata “profiles” (such as UMM-C for collection and UMM-G for granule). CMR provides services for mapping metadata records to and from any of the CMR-supported metadata standards, through UMM. Thus, CMR is able take metadata records of various source formats, and convert non-ISO 19115 metadata into robust and standards compliant ISO 19115 representation for interested clients. This can be seen in the diagram below: For example, for collection metadata records, a UMM-C record may be mapped to any other supported collection metadata standard such as ISO 19115-1, ISO 19115-2, ECHO 10, DIF 9, or DIF 10. Records created using any of those supported standards may be mapped to any other of those supported standards by first mapping to UMM-C. As additional metadata concepts are introduced to CMR, new ingest services will provide verification and search indexing capabilities across diverse metadata such as visualization and variable information.

Smith Jul 20, 2022 Image This FIRMS US/Canada Fire Map image of the Moose fire in Idaho was acquired on July 21, 2022, at 5:40 a.m., EDT.

Note: RT and URT data roll off the system after six hours as NRT data become available. Credit: FIRMS. When it comes to monitoring and fighting wildfires, accurate and timely data about a fire’s location, extent, intensity, and impact are critical. That’s why NASA funded the Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ) in 2007 and, more recently, partnered with the U.S. Forest Service to develop FIRMS US/Canada , a new instance of FIRMS that optimizes the Forest Service's distribution of active fire information by leveraging LANCE's web-based active fire mapping tools and capabilities for disseminating data, products, and services. Now, FIRMS has announced the release of ultra real-time (URT) data, which provide active fire data in seconds and make FIRMS’s value to the wildland fire community even greater. “[This] is the first routine service for detecting wildfires over the continental United States from NASA and NOAA low-Earth orbit satellites with a latency of less than 60 seconds from Earth observation to wildfire detection,” said Liam Gumley, a scientist with the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Space Science and Engineering Center ( SSEC ). URT data are made possible by an SSEC-developed system that receives, decodes, and processes data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) instrument aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership and NOAA-20 satellites to produce active fire data for the continental United States (CONUS) within 60 seconds using direct broadcast. The system capitalizes on SSEC’s access to direct broadcast antennas throughout the continental United States, as well as Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Software systems enable the SSEC to stream the direct broadcast data in real-time from each antenna to a central collection point at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, which then ingests, merges, and de-duplicates the data in real-time. The software is set up to process micro-granules from Level 0 through Level 1 to active fire Level 2 products using the same version of the thermal anomalies/fire code (i.e., the contextual fire algorithm code) that LANCE uses. The active fire data are then converted to Comma Separated Values (CSV) format and provided to FIRMS via a web-based application programming interface (API). The result is MODIS wildfire detections with a latency of approximately 25 seconds and VIIRS wildfire detections with a latency of approximately 50 seconds (relative to time of observation on the spacecraft).

According to Brad Quayle, a remote sensing and GIS specialist with the Forest Service's Geospatial Technology and Applications Center ( GTAC ), the fire data in FIRMS are being identified as URT so users can distinguish them from the near real-time MODIS and VIIRS data in FIRMS that are provided by the LANCE data stream. NASA and the Forest Service have been planning for the implementation of real-time MODIS and VIIRS data into FIRMS applications, and both were impressed with the system the SSEC developed, so NASA began coordinating with the SSEC to incorporate the URT data into FIRMS. The initial funding for integrating the URT active fire data into FIRMS is from the NASA Applied Sciences Program Wildland Fires program area and the agency-wide FireSense initiative. “The system significantly reduces the amount of time to process and access direct readout data compared to traditional processing workflow methods,” Quayle said. “The data are processed and available in seconds, as the satellite overpass is occurring, versus being available 15-20 minutes after the overpass has occurred.” The ability to access such low-latency data is of immense value to the wildfire community. “The more timely the data, the higher their value when assessing the location, extent, and intensity of newly detected fire activity,” said Quayle. “This timeliness also increases their potential for use as a tool to detect new fire starts. Having these data in FIRMS within a minute of a satellite overpass will help us identify where new starts may be occurring, particularly in remote, less populated areas.” There are, however, some limitations with URT data, including the possibility of technical issues associated with the use of direct readout antennas. “Terra’s direct broadcast signal uses the same frequency as the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN), so when the DSN is active out of Goldstone, California, the direct broadcast from Terra is temporarily halted for very short periods of time (typically less than a minute),” he said. “During those periods, no Terra MODIS direct readout data are received and there is a gap in the data for that very short period.” There may also be occasional issues with particular ground stations that may happen to be temporarily offline due to technical issues, but such instances are “relatively rare,” said Quayle. Fortunately, ground station coverage typically overlaps, which helps minimize any potential data gaps. Further, any data gaps that might occur will be filled with NRT MODIS and VIIRS data from LANCE, albeit with a longer latency. Quayle and Gumley also acknowledged that, although the MODIS and VIIRS instruments aboard Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, and NOAA-20 are well suited for detecting fires from low-Earth orbit, they may miss some ignitions given the infrequency of their observations. Active fire data from geostationary satellites could help fill that gap. “There are tradeoffs between low-Earth orbit satellite observations versus geostationary observations,” said Gumley. “The low-Earth orbit sensors, such as VIIRS and MODIS, can detect smaller fires, but each satellite only flies over the CONUS 2 to 3 times in daylight and 2 to 3 times at night. Geostationary satellites provide CONUS data at 10-, 5-, or 1-minute intervals, so they can detect more wildfires. However, their ability to detect small wildfires is not as good as the sensors on the satellites in low-Earth orbit.” Quayle concurs. “Geostationary satellite sensors, such as the Advanced Baseline Imager aboard NOAA’s GOES-16 satellite, can potentially provide more frequent updates on changes in fire spread and between low-Earth orbit observations, but at a coarser resolution and with other technical considerations,” he said. NASA is already planning to add active fire data from geostationary satellites to FIRMS in the coming weeks. As these continued improvements to FIRMS suggest, NASA and the Forest Service endeavor to establish a single, authoritative source of near real-time fire mapping, visualization, and geospatial data products for the United States and Canada. This enhanced cooperation will not only increase the fire community’s use of near real-time fire geospatial data products, it will expand NASA’s opportunity, under the auspices of LANCE, to evaluate and integrate additional sources of NASA, NOAA, and international space agency satellite data of value to the user community.

Where can I find the MODIS and VIIRS Active Fire User guides? For the most current information, use the Active Fire User Guides: VIIRS (Updated July 2018) MODIS Collection 6 Revision C (Updated December 2020) What are the key differences between URT/RT/NRT and Standard quality fire data? Standard data products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of Earth’s geophysical properties to support science. The ultra real-time (URT), real-time (RT), and near real-time (NRT) fire products are generated more rapidly than the standard processing allows to meet the needs of the applications community. To facilitate this, a number of changes have been made to the standard processing approach: For the URT and RT, direct broadcast data are used (see Questions about Real-Time (RT) and Ultra Real-Time (URT) active fire data ) and for NRT, data downlinked from the satellite are sorted, processed, and delivered in an expedited manner (as Session-based Production Data Sets). One key difference between the MODIS/Aqua NRT and Standard (Science Quality) Fire Products is the accuracy of the Fire locations (positions or geolocation). Unlike MODIS/Terra, VIIRS/Suomi NPP, and VIIRS/NOAA-20, the position of the Aqua satellite is not as well known when the NRT Fire Product is produced. Most of the time, the additional error introduced in the reported Fire location is small (< 100 m), but in some situations this position error may be large (several kilometers). In particular, the larger errors may occur after spacecraft maneuvers and during space weather events. The NRT Fire location accuracy is also degraded for MODIS/Terra, VIIRS/Suomi NPP, and VIIRS/NOAA-20 after spacecraft maneuvers, but the time period is typically shorter (< 2 hours for MODIS/Terra, VIIRS/Suomi NPP, and VIIRS/NOAA-20 vs. up to 12 hours for MODIS/Aqua). When the Standard Fire product are later processed, the best available satellite position data is used and the quality assurance team removes data degraded by spacecraft maneuvers. In addition, the Standard Fire products are typically later reprocessed and the Fire positions may be even more accurate in the reprocessed products. Routines used to derive Level 2 products (such as fire) do not make use of ancillary data, and so their codes are identical to the ones used in standard operations. However, please note: The data distributed via the FIRMS download tool does not contain the static sources/inferred hotspot \"type\" ( See the MODIS Active Fire User Guide ). The day/night column (also described on page 38 of the MODIS Active Fire User Guide) is currently calculated differently. The standard processing algorithm uses the solar zenith angle (SZA) to threshold the day/night value; if the SZA exceeds 85 degrees it is assigned a night value. SZA values less than 85 degrees are assigned a day time value. For the NRT algorithm the day/night flag is assigned by ascending (day) vs descending (night) observation. It is expected that the NRT assignment of the day/night flag will be amended to be consistent with the standard processing. What does a fire detection mean on the ground? Satellites take a ‘snapshot’ of events as they pass over Earth. Each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a pixel flagged as containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies (such as volcanoes). For MODIS the pixel is approximately 1 km and for VIIRS the pixel is approximately 375 m. The “location” is the center point of the pixel (not necessarily the coordinates of the actual fire). The actual pixel size varies with the scan and track (see: What does scan and track mean? ). The fire is often less than the size of the pixel (see: What size fires can be detected? ). We are not able to determine the exact fire size; what we do know is that at least one fire is located within the flagged pixel. Sometimes you will see several active fires in a line. This generally represents a fire front. Image Image What are the different sources of fire data in FIRMS? MODIS NRT C6.1 ( MCD14DL ) are the NRT MODIS (Terra and Aqua) Collection 6.1 data processed by NASA LANCE FIRMS. MCD14ML provided by FIRMS are a subset of the standard quality data processed by the MODIS Fire Team Science Computing Facility at the University of Maryland. These are available with a 2-3 month lag through the Archive Download Tool and can be viewed and queried in Fire Map . VIIRS 375 m NRT active fire data are available from Suomi NPP ( VNP14IMGTDL_NRT ) and NOAA-20 ( VJ114IMGTDL_NRT ). These are processed by NASA LANCE FIRMS. Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies (LFTA) product is generated from all daytime Operational Land Imager (OLI) acquisitions and currently provided for most of North America (CONUS, southern Canada and northern Mexico). The LFTA is currently produced through a collaboration by USGS EROS Data Center, NASA, and the USDA Forest Service. Daily Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI observations are processed by EROS and use the NASA-developed algorithm to produce active fire detection data that is ingested into FIRMS. Please note: A real-time (RT) and ultra real-time (URT) version of both MODIS and VIIRS active fire data are available for the US and Canada within minutes of satellite fly-over. See What are the real-time (RT) and ultra real-time (URT) data in FIRMS? . How often are the active fire data acquired? The MODIS instruments aboard the Terra and Aqua EOS satellites acquire data continuously, providing global coverage every 1-2 days. Terra (EOS AM) passes over the equator at approximately 10:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m., Mean Local Time (MLT), each day; Aqua (EOS PM) passes over the equator at approximately 1:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., MLT. There are at least 4 daily MODIS observations for almost every area on the equator, with the number of observations increasing (due to overlapping orbits) closer to the poles. The VIIRS instruments aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites also acquire data continuously. The 3,040 km VIIRS swath enables ≈15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator, thereby providing full global coverage every 12 hours. Suomi NPP has a nominal (equator-crossing) observation times at 1:30 p.m., MLT, and 1:30 a.m., MLT. NOAA-20 operates about 50 minutes ahead of Suomi NPP. Thanks to its polar orbit, mid-latitudes will experience 3-4 looks a day. How often is FIRMS updated? The FIRMS fire map is updated every 5 minutes, but please note that the data are derived from instruments onboard polar orbiting satellites (MODIS aboard Terra and Aqua and VIIRS aboard Suomi NPP and NOAA-20), and generally these have 2 overpasses a day (more towards the poles - see How often are the active fire data acquired? ). FIRMS generally makes the data available within 3 hours of a satellite observation (on a best effort basis). See also What time does the satellite pass over my area? The SHP KML CSV files are currently updated every 60 minutes. The near real-time alerts are run every 5 minutes. What time does the satellite pass over my area? In FIRMS Fire Map and NASA Worldview you can overlay the daily orbit tracks to see satellite acquisition times for your area of interest. Daily Terra, Aqua , Suomi NPP , and NOAA-20 global and regional orbit tracks are provided by https://www.space-track.org/ . For what dates are the fire data available? MODIS data are available from November 2000 (for Terra) and from July 2002 (for Aqua) to the present. VIIRS 375 m data are currently available from 20 January 2012 to the present (for Suomi NPP) and 1 January 2020 to the present (for NOAA-20). How are fires detected by satellite? Fire detection is performed using a contextual algorithm that exploits the strong emission of mid-infrared radiation from fires. The MODIS algorithm examines each pixel of the MODIS swath, and ultimately assigns to each pixel of the following classes: missing data, cloud, water, non-fire, fire, or unknown. More information can be found in: Giglio, L., Descloitres, J., Justice, C. O., & Kaufman, Y. (2003). An enhanced contextual fire detection algorithm for MODIS. Remote Sensing of Environment, 87: 273-282. doi:10.1016/S0034-4257(03)00184-6 In keeping with MODIS, the VIIRS algorithm is a hybrid thresholding and contextual algorithm using radiometric signals from 4 micron and 11 micron bands (M13 and M15, respectively) and additional bands and a suite of tests for internal cloud mask and rejection of false alarms. The product consists of simple file containing primarily latitude and longitude data for those pixels classified as thermal anomalies. More information can be found in: Schroeder, W., Oliva, P., Giglio, L., & Csiszar, I. A. (2014). The New VIIRS 375m active fire detection data product: algorithm description and initial assessment. Remote Sensing of Environment , 143: 85-96. doi:10.1016/j.rse.2013.12.008 Why was a particular fire not detected? There are several reasons why MODIS or VIIRS may not have detected a certain fire: The fire may have started and ended between satellite observations; cloud cover, heavy smoke, or tree canopy may completely obscure a fire; occasionally the instruments are inoperable and can observe nothing during these times (see data outages and known issues for MODIS and VIIRS ); or the fire may have been too small or too cool to be detected. The VIIRS 375 m active fire product provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas due to its higher spatial resolution and it has improved nighttime performance. For more information on the minimum size of fire that can be detected using MODIS data see \" What is the smallest fire size that can be detected?\" and \" How do I know if a fire detection was missed due to cloud or missing data? \" What are the attributes / fields of the active fire data? Attribute table for VIIRS Attribute table for MODIS I only see fire data available for the last 7 days on your website. How can I get older data? Data for the last 2 months can be downloaded as text (TXT) files and older data can be obtained through the MODIS Fire Archive Download Tool or from MODIS directly from the MODIS Fire Team Science Computing Facility at the University of Maryland . MODIS data are available from from November 2000 (for Terra) and from July 2002 (for Aqua) to the present. VIIRS 375 m data are available from 20 January 2012 to the present (for Suomi NPP) and 1 January 2020 to the present (For NOAA-20). What projection are the shapefiles in? The shapefiles are in the Geographic WGS84 projection. What is the detection confidence? The confidence value was added to help users gauge the quality of individual fire pixels is included in the Level 2 fire product. The confidence field should be used with caution; it is likely that it will vary in meaning in different parts of the world. Nevertheless some of our end users have found such a field to be useful in excluding false positive occurrences of fire. They are different for MODIS and VIIRS. For MODIS, the confidence value ranges from 0% to 100% and can be used to assign one of the three fire classes (low-confidence fire, nominal-confidence fire, or high-confidence fire) to all fire pixels within the fire mask. In some applications errors of commission (or false alarms) are particularly undesirable, and for these applications one might be willing to trade a lower detection rate to gain a lower false alarm rate. Conversely, for other applications missing any fire might be especially undesirable, and one might then be willing to tolerate a higher false alarm rate to ensure that fewer true fires are missed. Users requiring fewer false alarms may wish to retain only nominal- and high-confidence fire pixels and treat low-confidence fire pixels as clear, non-fire, land pixels. Users requiring maximum fire detectability who are able to tolerate a higher incidence of false alarms should consider all three classes of fire pixels. For VIIRS, the confidence values are set to low, nominal, and high; they are based on a collection of intermediate algorithm quantities used in the detection process and are intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of Sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15 K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those free of potential Sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15 K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels. The confidence value is application specific. This isn't very helpful, but unfortunately there's no way to establish an optimal cutoff a priori. Users have to adopt an empirical approach—what threshold works best for what I'm trying to do? Unfortunately the confidence values in the product do not directly correspond to the statistical confidence levels in reference to Type I and Type II errors. Are there any restrictions on using data or imagery from FIRMS? NASA supports an open data policy and we encourage the appropriate use of data and graphics from FIRMS; when doing so, please take a moment to make sure you get the correct citation— see the Citation Policy . Please also read the LANCE Disclaimer and the About FIRMS web page . Back to top What caveats should be considered when using active fire data from FIRMS? Are there ever false fire detections or data artifacts? To avoid the occurrence of false alarms over bright/reflective surfaces (e.g., metallic factory rooftops), the VIIRS and MODIS algorithms use slightly more conservative tests to avoid the effects of Sun glint. Super Heated Smoke Plumes A few VIIRS active fire pixels are occasionally located outside the reported perimeter of a large wildfire. If this happens, users may need to look for additional clues to see if it is a data artifact. There have been a few instances when tall superheated plumes carrying large volumes of hot material into the air are formed over large and intense wildfires; when these occur the VIIRS instrument detects& the surface fire along with part of the plume and categorizes them as active fires. Those occurrences typically share the following set of conditions: (i) Nighttime detection. This is the period during which the VIIRS active fire product is particularly responsive to heat sources thereby favoring plume detection. However, this can also occur during the day time with; (ii) Very large wildfires undergoing explosive growth and accompanied by rapid/vertically elongated plume development. Enough hot material must entrain the plume creating a distinguishable thermal signal (i.e., one that significantly exceeds the fire-free surface background); (iii) High scan angle. This is what will ultimately produce the detections extending beyond the actual fire perimeter. The parallax effect causes the tall/superheated plume detection pixel(s) to be displaced laterally when projected onto the surface. Displaced pixels will be located on the fire perimeter’s side further away from the image center and closer to the swath’s edge. If those conditions apply, look for alternative observations (previous/next observation) acquired closer to nadir and try and prioritize the use of the fire detection data accordingly. Unfortunately, the VIIRS active fire algorithm isn’t currently able to distinguish nighttime surface fire pixels from the isolated plume detections due to strong similarities between their radiometric signatures. Related content: Is the VIIRS 375 m product still being refined? What is the detection confidence? False fires due to super heated smoke plume in nighttime detections (3 August 2018) Note on False Fires in VIIRS/NOAA-20 (17 July 2020) How do I know if a fire detection was missed due to cloud or missing data? An indication of cloud cover or missing data can be obtained by viewing the co-incident MODIS or VIIRS imagery in FIRMS Fire Map or Worldview . To take cloud and missing data in to account, it may be more appropriate to use one of the 1 km Level 3 or CMG fire products (see the discussion in the MODIS Fire User Guide ). How appropriate are the hotspot/fire locations for my research? The MODIS and VIIRS fire locations are good for determining the location of active fires, providing information on the spatial and temporal distribution of fires, and comparing data between years. The active fire pixel locations may not always be the most appropriate source of fire related information; the data do not provide any information on cloud cover or missing data. Depending on the analysis you are performing, it is sometimes possible to derive misleading or even incorrect results by ignoring the other types of pixels. In some cases it is more appropriate to use one of the Level 3 or CMG fire products. For more discussion on this, see FAQ \"What is the Climate Modeling Grid (CMD) fire product? and \"What is the difference between NRT and Standard quality fire data?\" What is the Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) fire product? The CMG fire products are gridded statistical summaries of fire pixel information intended for use in regional and global modeling. The products are currently generated at 0.5 degree spatial resolution for time periods of 1 calendar month (MOD14CMH/MYD14CMH) and 8 days (MOD14C8H/MYD14C8H). Higher resolution 0.25 degree CMG fire products will eventually be produced as well. More information can be found in the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User's Guide . Can active fires be detected below the forest canopy? The likelihood of detecting a fire beneath the tree canopy is unknown, but likely to be very low. Understory fires are typically small, and with the tree canopy obstructing the view of the fire, detection will be very unlikely. Are all active fire hotspots vegetation fires? No. An active fire represents the center of a pixel flagged as containing 1 or more actively burning hotspots /fires. In most cases fires are vegetation fires, but sometimes it is a volcanic eruption or the flare from a gas well. There is no way of knowing which type of thermal anomaly is detected based on the MODIS or VIIRS data alone. Can I estimate burned area from active fire data? It is not recommended to use active fire locations to estimate burned area due to spatial and temporal sampling issues. Determining this to an acceptable degree of accuracy is generally not possible due to nontrivial spatial and temporal sampling issues. For some applications, however, acceptable accuracy can be achieved, although the effective area burned per fire pixel is not simply a constant, but rather varies with respect to several different vegetation and fire-related variables. See Giglio et al. (2006) for more information. See \" Where can I get the MODIS burned area product? \" Can you use the active fire data for detecting volcanoes or volcanic eruptions? The algorithm routinely detects active volcanoes but the active fire product has not been validated against independent data for its ability to detect volcanoes. There is a separate near-real time MODIS product (MODVOLC) specifically for volcanoes—see http://modis.higp.hawaii.edu/ . What is FRP and what factors should be considered across sensors? Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is the rate of radiative energy emission per time unit from all fires within a pixel. FRP has been extensively used as a proxy of fire intensity to characterize fire types and is related to the rate of biomass combustion and rate of emissions. FRP estimates are provided for active fire data from MODIS, VIIRS and geostationary sensors used in FIRMS. Sensor spatial resolution, saturation temperature of thermal bands, satellite view zenith angle, time of satellite observation, etc. can affect the accuracy and variability of FRP estimates. Users should consider these factors whether comparing FRP information from a specific sensor or multiple sensors. Back to top Questions about VIIRS active fire data The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is an instrument aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 weather satellites. VIIRS was launched on Suomi NPP on October 28, 2011, and again on NOAA-20 (formally known as Joint Polar Satellite System-1 [JPSS-1]) on November 18, 2017. The VIIRS instrument will be launched on JPSS-2 in 2022 and join NOAA-20 and Suomi NPP in the same orbit. If you wish to view the VIIRS reflectance imagery that corresponds to the active fire detections, you can display this in FIRMS Fire Map or Worldview . What is the VIIRS 375 m Active Fire Product? The VIIRS 375 m ( VNP14IMGTDL_NRT ) active fire product is the latest product to be added to FIRMS. It provides data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. The 375 m data complements MODIS fire detections; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection, but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375 m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. What is the temporal frequency of the VIIRS 375 m fire data? The VIIRS instrument aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites acquire data continuously. The 3,040 km VIIRS swath enables ≈15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator, thereby providing full global coverage every 12 hours. Suomi NPP has a nominal (equator-crossing) observation times at 1:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., Mean Local Time (MLT); NOAA-20 operates about 50 minutes ahead of Suomi NPP. Thanks to its polar orbit, mid-latitudes will experience 3-4 looks a day. What is the spatial resolution of the data? The 375 m data describe the nominal resolution after native data are spatially aggregated (see figure below). Image Spatial resolution of VIIRS imagery data as a function of scan angle. The three distinct regions represent unique data aggregation zones extending from nadir to the edge of swath. The aggregation scheme changes across three distinct image regions. In the first region (nadir to 31.59° scan angle), three native pixels are aggregated in the along scan (cross-track) direction to form one data sample in the Level 1 image. In the second region (31.59° to 44.68° scan angle), two native pixels are aggregated to form one data sample. Finally in the third and last region (44.68° to 56.06° - edge of swath) one native pixel will result in one data sample. All five 375 m channels are aggregated onboard the spacecraft before the data are transmitted to the ground stations, whereas a subset of the VIIRS 750 m data (dual-gain channels only) are aggregated on the ground. What is the main difference between the VIIRS 375 m and 750 m active fire data? The two data products use similar methodologies to detect active fire pixels although differences in the spectral characteristics of the VIIRS channels used in each case led to unique algorithms. Because of its improved spatial resolution, the 375 m algorithm will tend to detect more fire pixels compared to the 750 m data set. That difference is particularly pronounced during the nighttime part of the orbit when the occurrence of smaller/cooler fires will favor the 375 m product. Will the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm always outperform the 750 m one? Generally speaking, the higher resolution product will achieve higher probability of fire detection in both day and nighttime scenes. However, areas subject to strong solar reflectance associated with Sun glint could see a few 750 m fire pixels without a corresponding 375 m fire detection. This is attributed to the relatively shorter wavelength of the 375 m mid-infrared channel used in the fire algorithm, which will experience greater influence of the solar component. In order to minimize the associated consequences, namely the occurrence of false alarms over bright/reflective surfaces (e.g., metallic factory rooftops), the 375 m algorithm uses slightly more conservative tests to avoid the effects of Sun glint over those areas. Are those few isolated fire pixels in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean real? Those occurrences are typically associated with spurious fire detections due to the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly. The 375 m active fire algorithm contains a specific filter to flag those occurrences as low confidence detections. However, in some cases (average 2-3 pixels every night) the spurious signal generated in the input Level 1 data is confused for a regular fire pixel and therefore assigned a nominal confidence flag. Note that verified true positives can also be found over South Atlantic Ocean waters along the southeast coast of Brazil and the west coast of Africa where oil rigs normally operate. Are the VIIRS 375 m (and 750 m) active fire data science-ready? The VIIRS active fire data have been extensively tested since routine production of the mission’s data record started in 19 January 2012. Numerous bad scan episodes (i.e., pixel clusters containing spurious radiances extending across the swath) were found in the Level 1 input data during the initial 18-24 months of the time series (Csiszar, et al., 2014). Those anomalies were gradually addressed by the VIIRS science team and their occurrence has dropped to virtually zero with the implementation of revised Level 1 data processing packages in 2015. Initial assessment of both VIIRS 375 m and 750 m was implemented over a few experimental sites indicating consistent fire detection and characterization performance. Additional data comparison analyses were implemented using near coincident Aqua/MODIS and TET-1 (German Aerospace Center) active fire data, which again showed consistent performance of the VIIRS active fire products across different observation conditions. Consequently, we consider the current data of good enough quality for use in fire management applications and scientific studies. However, users must be aware of the data quality limitations involving the archived data. NASA will be spearheading future data reprocessing efforts in order to generate a consistent time series for the VIIRS Level 1 and 2 data. Is the VIIRS 375 m product still being refined? Absolutely. The current suite represents the second release of the VNP14IMG and VNP14 active fire algorithms; data imperfections can—and likely will—occur. As with other satellite data products, the VIIRS active fire algorithm development undergoes routine quality control during which data issues such as omission errors, false alarms, and other anomalies are investigated and addressed. New versions of the products will be released once algorithm revisions are implemented and tested. Users are encouraged to report back to the science team when encountering potential data discrepancies. Where do I go for more information? Schroeder, W., Oliva, P., Giglio, L., & Csiszar, I. A.

If you wish to view the MODIS reflectance imagery that corresponds to the active fire detections, please go to Worldview . What does a MODIS active fire detection mean on the ground? Satellites take a ‘snapshot’ of events as they pass over earth. Each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a 1 km (approx.) pixel flagged as containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies (such as volcanoes). The “location” is the center point of the pixel (not necessarily the coordinates of the actual fire). The actual pixel size varies with the scan and track (see: What does scan and track mean? ). The fire is often less than 1 km in size (see: What size fires can be detected? ). We are not able to determine the exact fire size; what we do know is that at least one fire is located within that 1 km pixel. Sometimes you will see several active fires in a line. This generally represents a fire front. Image Are there any missing MODIS fire data? Terra was launched 18 December 1999 and Aqua was launched 4 May 2002. High quality active fire observations are available from the Terra satellite starting November 2000 and from the Aqua satellite starting 4 July 2002 onwards. In the fire data archive, there are several days where data were not collected and days with lower than usual fire counts due to reasons such as sensor outage. These include, but are not limited to: 15 April 2001, 15 June to 3 July 2001, and 19 to 28 March 2002. What does scan and track mean? The scan value represents the spatial-resolution in the East-West direction of the scan and the track value represents the North-South spatial resolution of the scan. It should be noted that the pixel size is not always 1 km across the scan track. The pixels at the “Eastern” and the “Western” edges of the scan are bigger than 1 km. It is 1 km only along the nadir (exact vertical from the satellite). Thus, the values shown for scan and track represent the actual spatial resolution of the scanned pixel. What is the brightness temperature? The brightness temperature of a fire pixel is measured (in Kelvin) using the MODIS channels 21/22 and channel 31. Brightness temperature is actually a measure of the photons at a particular wavelength received by the spacecraft, but presented in units of temperature. What are MODIS collections? Reprocessing of the entire MODIS data archive is periodically performed to incorporate better calibration, algorithm refinements, and improved upstream products into all MODIS products. The updated MODIS data archive resulting from each reprocessing is referred to as a collection. Later collections supersede all earlier collections. For Terra MODIS, Collection 1 consists of the first products generated following launch. Terra MODIS data were reprocessed for the first time in June 2001 to produce Collection 3. Note that this first reprocessing was numbered Collection 3, rather than Collection 2, as one would expect. Collection 3 was also the first produced for the Aqua MODIS products. Collection 4 reprocessing was initiated in December 2002 for Terra MODIS and somewhat later for the Aqua MODIS. Collection 5 began reprocessing in early 2007. Improvements in Collection 5 included adding the Fire Radiative Power value to the fire detections and refining the detection confidence to more accurately identify questionable active fire pixels. Collection 6 is the latest collection and uses the most up-to-date algorithms. In terms of fire detections, the key differences between Collection 5 and Collection 6 are that: Collection 6 extends processing to oceans and other large bodies, including detection of off-shore gas flaring; there is also a reduction in false alarms in the Amazon caused by small forest clearings and there will be an improved cloud mask. MODIS Process Version : For the standard quality data there is also a production code version number, e.g., 6.02 (Collection 6.0 process version 2). See the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User's Guide Revision C . Where can I get the MODIS burned area product? MODIS Active Fire & Burned Area Products web site and the MODIS Burned Area User Guide (Updated December 2020) and the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User Guide . What size fires can be detected? In any given scene the minimum detectable fire size is a function of many different variables (scan angle, biome, Sun position, land surface temperature, cloud cover, amount of smoke and wind direction, etc.), so the precise value will vary slightly with these conditions. MODIS routinely detects both flaming and smoldering fires 1000 m 2 in size. Under very good observing conditions (e.g., near nadir, little or no smoke, relatively homogeneous land surface, etc.) flaming fires one tenth this size can be detected. Under pristine (and extremely rare) observing conditions even smaller flaming fires 50 m 2 can be detected. It is not recommended to estimate burned area from the active fire data, see: Can I estimate burned area using the active fire data? . Unlike most contextual fire detection algorithms designed for satellite sensors that were never intended for fire monitoring (e.g., AVHRR, VIRS, ATSR), there is no upper limit to the largest and/or hottest fire that can be detected with MODIS. Image The diagram shows the day and night relationship of fire size and fire temperature, in different biomes, to the probability of being detected by MODIS ( Giglio, et al. (2003) ). What validation of the MODIS active fire products has been performed? Validation of the Terra MODIS Fire Product has primarily been performed using coincident observations from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) ; see the MODIS Land Team Validation page, and publications by Csiszar, et al. (2006) and two publications from Morisette, et al. (2005) for details. A very brief discussion of the general validation procedure, with some preliminary results, can be found in the Justice, et al. (2002) publication. Where can I get more information on the MODIS Fire Products? For more information on the active fire product and other MODIS fire products, please refer to the papers by Louis Giglio found here as well as the MODIS Active Fire Burned Area Products website and the MODIS Burned Area User Guide (Updated December 2020) and the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User Guide (Updated December 2020) . Back to top Questions about Real-Time (RT) and Ultra Real-Time (URT) active fire data What are the real-time (RT) and ultra real-time (URT) data in FIRMS? NASA EOSDIS defines real-time (RT) data as data that are available to the end user within one hour of the satellite fly-over (see What is Data Latency? and What time does the satellite pass over my area? ). Ultra real-time (URT) data are available much quicker—within minutes. Within FIRMS, the URT data are available within a minute of satellite overpass for select direct readout stations in the U.S. and Canada. What is \"direct broadcast\"? Direct broadcast, In addition to storing collected observation data for later download at designated intervals, some satellites have the capability to immediately broadcast this raw data to the ground. This is known as direct broadcast . As Earth is observed by the satellite, the data are formatted and transmitted to any user below with an antenna and other necessary equipment to receive and process the data. The Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, and NOAA-20 satellites all have direct broadcast capability. What is \"direct readout\"? The acquisition of freely transmitted direct broadcast satellite data by users with compatible ground receiving equipment is known as direct readout . Data can be collected by direct readout ground stations while they are in direct line of sight to satellites while they are visible above the horizon. Are there particular differences between URT data, RT data and NRT data? Ultra Real-Time (URT), Real-Time (RT), and Near Real-Time (NRT) data are all relative forms of low-latency data products made available more quickly than standard processing to support environmental monitoring, response to hazard/disaster events, etc. NRT data processing frameworks, such as NASA LANCE, leverage operational Level 0 global data streams for several NASA missions and provide Level 2 products 1-3 hours of satellite overpass. RT and URT data are predicated on the use of raw satellite data collected via direct readout ground stations. These ground stations are operated by various agencies and institutions, located around the globe and provide regional coverage. Ground stations typically process raw direct readout data to Level 0 to Level 1 to Level 2 data 30-60 minutes over satellite overpass and are considered RT data. Recently developed data processing technologies can now process direct readout data from Level 0 to Level 2 data products within 1 minute of satellite observation and are considered URT data. How are URT active fire detection data integrated and used with NRT active fire detection data in FIRMS? URT active fire detection data provided by select ground stations are integrated into FIRMS fire maps, KMZs and web map services within minutes of satellite observation. NRT active fire detection data replace the URT data in FIRMS mapping and data products and services as they become available 1-3 hours later. This integration of the data is seamless and not noticeable to the user unless there is a temporary anomaly occurring in either data source (e.g., a gap or artifact in the URT direct readout data stream). How do I identify the NRT, RT and URT data? FIRMS Fire Map and Map Services : To view the NRT, RT, and URT data in the FIRMS fire map, select the \"Time Based\" option in FIRMS. This symbolizes the active fire detections by time since detection. Both RT and URT data will display in the <1 hour category while NRT data will display in the 1-3 hour category or later categories. Click on active fire detection locations to view the attributes. The RT and URT fires will have a “Version” value (e.g., 2.0) followed by “RT” or “URT”. NRT fires will have a Version” value followed by “NRT.” FIRMS KMZs : \"Active fire detection footprint and centroid\" KMZs symbolize active fire detection by time since detection. Time since detection KMZs symbolizes the active fire detections by time since detection. Both RT and URT data will display in the <1 hour category while NRT data will display in the 1-3 hour category or later categories. RT and URT data are not distinguished in the KMZ attributes. Are URT data provided for all FIRMS products? So far, URT active fire detection data are available in FIRMS interactive maps, KMZs, and web services. Are URT data provided globally? URT data are currently provided by four (4) select direct readout ground stations—one in Mayaguez, PR (red) and Hampton, VA (black) and two in Madison, WI (blue) (see graphic below). Each ground station can receive direct readout data when satellite orbits intersect their respective station masks. Additional United States ground stations will continue to be integrated with the objective of providing URT coverage for the U.S., Canada, and Central America. Integration of ground stations elsewhere on the globe will be evaluated and determined at a later date. Image Current (solid lines) and Planned (dotted lines) Coverage of Ultra Real-Time and Real-Time Active Fire Data What is the objective of providing URT data? Remote sensing observations and derived science products provide a \"snapshot\" of conditions at the time of satellite observation and are used to assess the situation and inform decisions. Consequently, the value of satellite data used for operational detection and monitoring of wildfires and other hazard/disaster events is inversely proportional to their latency. In other words, the value of the data typically increases with decreasing latency in data availability since satellite observation. Back to top Geostationary active fire data How are \"geostationary\" active fire data different from the other data provided by FIRMS? Geostationary satellite sensors view the same area of Earth’s surface at all times while polar-orbiting sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS, typically view the same area of Earth’s surface twice daily. Consequently, geostationary satellite sensors can provide repeated observations on a sub-hourly basis, making it possible to detect fires not detectable at longer temporal intervals. Geostationary satellites provide data at 10-15 minute intervals, so they can detect more fire events and capture their growth and change. However, the spatial resolution of geostationary satellite data are coarser and therefore less sensitive to small fires. Where does the geostationary active fire data come from and how can I get more information about them?

The attributes are described in the following table: Attribute Short Description Long Description Latitude Latitude (decimal degrees) Latitude of pixel center. Note: Pixel size/dimension is affected by satellite view geometry and curvature of Earth’s surface. Consequently, pixel size becomes more distorted (larger) with increasing distance from the point immediately below the satellite. The reported coordinate is the center of each pixel’s footprint.

GOES active fire detections occur every 10 minutes and should be available within FIRMS in approximately 20-30 minutes. SEVIRI active fire detections occur every 15 minutes and should be available within FIRMS in approximately 30 minutes. Himawari active fire detections occur every 10 minutes and should be available within FIRMS in approximately 30 minutes. What size of fires can be detected with geostationary satellite observations? GOES - The theoretical minimum detectable fire size is approximately 0.004 km 2 at nadir in optimum viewing conditions, burning at 800 K (Schmidt et al., 2013). Meteosat SEVIRI - The theoretical minimum detectable fire size for “actively burning fires” is approximately 0.0001 of the area of a 3km SEVIRI pixel at nadir or approximately 0.0009km 2 (900m 2 ) (Schmidt et al., 2013). Himawari - Documentation describing the minimum detectable fire size of Himawari AHI using JAXA's Wild Fire product algorithm is currently limited but performance is anticipated to be similar to GOES ABI. Several recent research efforts demonstrate the use of Himawari AHI using customized/adapted fire detection algorithms with varying results.

Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 15(22): 13217–13239. doi:10.5194/acp-15-13217-2015 What is the spatial resolution of the geostationary satellite observations? The thermal bands, used to detect active fires, have a spatial resolution directly below the satellite (known as the “sub-satellite point”) of 2km for GOES and Himawari, and 3km for Meteosat SEVIRI. However, as already noted, the spatial resolution of the pixel (i.e., the pixel size) systematically grows away from the sub-satellite point towards the edge of the disk (Figures 1-4). Please note each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a pixel flagged as containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies (such as volcanoes). Image Please note the pixel size systematically grows away from the sub-satellite point towards the edge of the disk (see Figures 1 - 4). The following figures (Figures 1-4) illustrate how the spatial resolution of the geostationary satellites increases away from the sub-satellite point - please note all measurements are in km 2 . Image Figure 1. Coverage of GOES-18 indicating the variation in pixel area (in km²) Image Figure 2. Coverage of GOES-16 indicating the variation in pixel area (in km²). Image Figure 3. Coverage of MSG SEVIRI indicating the variation in pixel area (in km²). Image Figure 4. Coverage of Himawari-8 indicating the variation in pixel area (in km²). Why are the geostationary fire data filtered in FIRMS? The SEVIRI and Himawari data are made available from EUMETSAT and CAM. The data have a 65-degree view zenith angle cut-off due to the large pixel size at high latitudes. Sun glint and bright areas particularly over water may cause spurious fire detections. The following images provide examples of where spurious fire detections have been noted. Image This series (1 of 3) of FIRMS screenshots are from August 11, 2022 showing fires detected in the Serra da Estrela National Park, Portugal. This first screenshot shows a MODIS/Terra 7,2,1 Corrected Reflectance, which shows burned area in reddish-brown and an active fire front in orange. Image Image 2 of 3 this series of FIRMS screenshots from August 11, 2022 showing fires detected in the Serra da Estrela National Park, Portugal.

Image Image 3 of 3 in this series of FIRMS screenshots from August 11, 2022 showing fires detected in the Serra da Estrela National Park, Portugal. This third screenshot shows a MODIS/Terra 7,2,1 Corrected Reflectance, overlain with VIIRS active fire detections shown as red pixels and Meteosat-11 SEVIRI FRP pixels shown as pink pixels. Some spurious SEVIRI fire detections are evident. The FDC algorithm is still under development. The data shown in FIRMS are filtered to show fire detections with higher confidence values; these are classes 10 and 30, and 11 and 31. These criteria are driven by the validation analysis (See Hall et al 2019) and a qualitative review of the current algorithm output. The full list of classes available is outlined in the table below: Class Description 10 or 30 Good quality (highest confidence) fire detections** 11 or 31 Saturated fire pixel** 12 or 32 Cloud contaminated fire pixel 13 or 33 High probability fire pixels that do not satisfy requirements to be categorized as good quality fire detections 14 or 34 High probability fire pixels that do not satisfy requirements to be categorized as good quality fire detections 15 or 35 Low probability fire pixels that do not satisfy requirements to be categorized as good quality fire detections **indicates the classes shown in FIRMS Our qualitative assessment indicates some spurious fire detections are showing (see example below). This could be due to sun glint or bright water, so users are requested to use the data with caution. If in doubt, we recommend users look for coincident fire detections from MODIS or VIIRS in the vicinity. If they are present, the user can have more confidence in the geostationary data. Image In this screenshot from FIRMS, on 15 July 2022, the GOES FDC data from NOAA (shown in pink) along the lake edge are thought to be false positives / spurious fire detections. Users should exercise caution when using the data. What validation of geostationary active fire data has been conducted? Satellite-derived active fire products are validated with spatially and temporally coincident observations from higher resolution sensors. Landsat and Sentinel-2 are both appropriate sensors for validating geostationary active fire products. Given the Landsat and Sentinel-2 overpass times, any validation efforts will be focused on certain times of the day, therefore, false positives associated with (for example) unique solar angle issues may be missed.

FRP-PIXEL Product The key outputs from the FRP-PIXEL algorithm are active fire pixel detections and fire characteristics including fire radiative power (FRP), FRP uncertainty, active fire temperature, and fire detection confidence levels. The detection algorithm used in the FRP-PIXEL product is based on the principles applied to generate active fire detections within the MODIS Fire Products (Giglio et al., 2003). The algorithm works on statistics derived primarily from middle-infrared (MIR) and thermal infrared (TIR1) brightness temperature imagery. On a first pass, a series of absolute thresholds applied to these data are used to detect “potential” fire pixels. These pixels are then further assessed as true or false fire detections based on a series of further contextual tests based on statistics derived from immediate neighboring non-fire background pixels. A more complete description of the algorithm can be found in (Govaerts et al., 2010; Wooster et al., 2015). The FRP-PIXEL product is available every 15 minutes for the SEVIRI full-disk and every 10 minutes for the AHI and ABI disks. The spatial resolution of the product at the sub-satellite point is 3-km for the SEVIRI data and 2-km for the AHI and ABI, but the pixel size systematically grows with increasing view zenith angle (VZA) from the sub-satellite point towards the edge of the disk (See: What is the spatial resolution of the geostationary satellite observations? ). GOES FDC-HSC Product The FDC-HSC product is available every 10 minutes and contains information on the fire pixel locations, sub-pixel fire characteristics including active fire area and temperature, and FRP. The current FDC-HSC algorithm is a multispectral contextual algorithm designed to identify fire pixels through a decision-tree approach comparing them with their neighboring non-fire background pixels. The FDC-HSC algorithm uses a two-step approach. The first step is designed to identify all potential fire pixels while the second step further confirms and then characterizes the sub-pixel fire activity. What are the Product Uncertainties and Limitations? The FRP-PIXEL and FDC-HSC products are subject to several sources of uncertainties due to the characteristics of geostationary satellite full-disk data and associated image processing. Among these limitations: The spatial resolution of the data leads to missed smaller/less intense fires. Furthermore, the sensitivity to small/less intense fires varies away from the sub-satellite point. The FRP-derived value is sensitive to the fire location within the pixel. This effect is due to the shape of the point spread function, i.e., its departure from an ideal rectangular box. A fire located at the center of the instrument’s instantaneous field-of-view will elevate the pixel temperature much more than a fire located far away from its center. The non-linearity of the SEVIRI 3.9-μm channel above 310 K and the saturation of that band above 335 K can produce errors in the FRP estimate. Similarly, the saturation of the GOES-R ABI and AHI 3.9-μm channel above 400 K can produce errors in FRP. Back to top Landsat Fire Data What is the Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies Product? The Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies (LFTA) product is predicated on previous NASA-sponsored research to develop an active fire detection algorithm for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) aboard Terra. ASTER multispectral imagery and derived active fire detection data have been routinely used over the past two decades to validate active fire products from MODIS and geostationary sensors. The LFTA product was added to FIRMS in August 2022. Developed under the auspices of the NASA Applied Sciences Wildland Fire Program, the product is based on multispectral imagery acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites. The 30 m active fire detection data has 1,000 times and 160 times finer spatial resolution than the 1 km MODIS and 375 m VIIRS active fire detections, respectively. However, unlike MODIS and VIIRS, Landsat does not provide comprehensive global coverage on a daily basis. Each Landsat satellite typically images the same location on Earth every 16 days, but provides spatially explicit data and detail of observable fire activity at the time of the satellite overpass. These data augment fire management capabilities when available and can potentially enable applications at tactical scales. The LFTA product is generated from all daytime OLI acquisitions and currently provided for most of North America (CONUS, southern Canada and northern Mexico). Increased geographic coverage for the product is under consideration and will be investigated in the near future. Targeted nighttime OLI data collection for most of North America is also possible (OLI data are collected by request at nighttime), potentially increasing the opportunity for more frequent observations for selected geographic areas of heightened wildfire activity, but opportunities for nighttime observations are much more limited due to several factors. What is the temporal frequency of Landsat observations and derived active fire data? The OLI sensor aboard the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites each image the entire Earth every 16 days at the mid latitudes. The respective orbits of the two satellites are 8 days out of phase so when considered collectively, the entire planet is imaged at least every 8 days. Active fire detection data are derived from multispectral imagery acquired by OLI and provided daily for each of the scheduled WRS-2 paths imaged by Landsat 8 and 9 on a given date. Please consult the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 orbit tracks on the FIRMS fire maps to visualize the time of Landsat observations for a selected date (as depicted below). Additional active fire detection data from tasked nighttime Landsat OLI observations are possible, but not routinely conducted. Image The FIRMS fire map interface can display Landsat orbit tracks for user-selected dates with time of observation. True color and false color Landsat HLS imagery can also be displayed to view with active fire detection data. This display of a June 6, 2022, Landsat 8 acquisition provides the user the coverage provided by a single 185 km Landsat swath. What is the spatial resolution of the Landsat observations and derived active fire data? Each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a 30 m pixel flagged as containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies (such as active volcanoes). The “location” is the center point of the pixel (not necessarily the coordinates of the actual fire). What size of fires can be detected with Landsat? Landsat provides better active fire detection performance compared to coarser spatial resolution sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS. Flaming fires as small as approximately 4 m 2 have a better than 50% chance of detection during the daytime observations. Nighttime detection of similar fire activity improves to an area as small as 1 m 2 . Image Schroeder, W., Oliva, P., Giglio, L., Quayle, B., Lorenz, E., & Morelli, F. (2016). Active fire detection using Landsat-8/OLI data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 185: 210-220. doi:10.1016/j.rse.2015.08.032 Why are Landsat fire data only available for North America? The Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies (LFTA) product is currently produced through a collaboration by USGS EROS Data Center, NASA, and the USDA Forest Service. Daily Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI observations are processed by EROS and use the NASA-developed algorithm to produce active fire detection data that is ingested into FIRMS. Currently, only Landsat 8 and 9 OLI data collected by the USGS EROS Landsat Ground Station in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, are used to produce active fire detection data. The coverage of the USGS EROS Landsat Ground Station in Sioux Falls is highlighted in the figure below. Expansion of the geographic coverage for the product is possible through the integration of additional near real-time Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI data from other ground stations. Feasibility to include additional ground stations for North America and elsewhere is currently being investigated. Image Landsat ground stations for North America. The USGS EROS Landsat ground station (South Dakota) and the NOAA Gilmore Creek ground station both collect Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI data. The Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation ground station (Canada) collects Landsat 8 OLI data. Recorded and real-time OLI data from Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 are collected by the EROS and Gilbert Creek ground stations when either satellite is within \"line of sight\". This condition is achieved when the Landsat orbit passes within the green circles on the map. Near real-time Landsat 8 OLI data can be collected by the Prince Albert ground station when Landsat 8 is within its \"line of sight\" (red circle). What is the temporal extent of Landsat Active Fire and Thermal Anomalies product in FIRMS? The temporal extent of Landsat active fire data currently reaches back to June 2022. Processing of earlier acquisitions by Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 is possible, but not planned at this time. What are the attributes of the Landsat fire data? The attributes are described in the following table: Attribute Short Description Long Description Satellite Satellite L8 = Landsat 8; L9 = Landsat 9 Latitude Latitude (decimal degrees) Latitude of pixel center Longitude Longitude (decimal degrees) Longitude of pixel center Path Path Path number as identified in the World Reference System-2 (WRS-2) Row Row Row number as identified in the World Reference System-2 (WRS-2) Track Track The pixel location in the along-track dimension of the Landsat path based on the OLI Line-of-Sight (LOS) coordinate system. Generally increases in value from north to south for daytime and nighttime overpasses. Scan Scan The pixel location in the cross-track dimension of the Landsat path based on the OLI Line-of-Sight (LOS) coordinate system. Generally increases in value from west to east for daytime and nighttime overpasses. Acquire_Time Date and time of start of scan Date and time of acquisition/overpass of the satellite (in UTC). The format is YYYY-MM-DD followed by HH:MM-SS. For example, 2022-07-23 10:09:00. Confidence Confidence Value domain: H, M, and L: H: Higher confidence M: Medium confidence L: Lower confidence Version Version (FIRMS reference only) 1.0.7 NRT DayNight Day or Night D= Daytime fire, N= Nighttime fire What validation of the Landsat fire products has been performed? Validation of the Landsat active fire product has primarily been performed using available high resolution aerial and commercial satellite imagery and coincident/near coincident 1 km Terra and Aqua MODIS active fire data, and 750 m and 375 m Suomi NPP VIIRS active fire data. A discussion of the validation procedures and results can be found in Schroeder, et al. (2016). Where can I find more information about the Landsat fire data? The Landsat active fire detection algorithm is based on the legacy algorithm developed for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Development of the Landsat algorithm was conducted under the auspices of the NASA Applied Sciences Program . Please refer to the following papers by Louis Giglio and Wilfrid Schroder and the NASA Applied Sciences Program project summary for more information on the Landsat active fire algorithm and product. Schroeder, W., Oliva, P., Giglio, L., Quayle, B., Lorenz, E., & Morelli, F. (2016). Active fire detection using Landsat-8/OLI data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 185: 210-220. doi:10.1016/j.rse.2015.08.032 Giglio, L., Csiszar, I., Restás, Á., Morisette, J. T., Schroeder, W., Morton, D., & Justice, C. O. (2008). Active fire detection and characterization with the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER). Remote Sensing of Environment, 112(6): 3055-3063. doi:10.1016/j.rse.2008.03.003 How does Landsat active fire data compare with MODIS and VIIRS active fire data? Landsat active fire data are more than 1,000 times more resolute than MODIS and more than 150 times more resolute than VIIRS. The algorithm routinely detects fires as small as a few square meters or smaller, providing spatially explicit detail of the location and extent of fire activity at the time of a satellite overpass. Active fire fronts and scattered smaller fires within the fire perimeter are routinely detected. However, these relatively high spatial resolution data are provided at a lower temporal resolution compared to the daily observation frequency afforded by MODIS and VIIRS. Between both Landsat OLI instruments, areas in the lower to mid latitudes are imaged every 8 days. The temporal resolution of Landsat data can be increased though the collection of nighttime Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 imagery for targeted areas. The following graphic shows Landsat active fire data compared for MODIS (Terra and Aqua) (1km) and VIIRS (Suomi NPP and NOAA-20) (375m) for the Double Creek Fire in Northeast Oregon on September 10, 2022. Image Multi sensor imaging of the Double Creek Fire in Oregon on 10 September 2022. Active fire detections derived from Landsat-9/OLI 30 m (displayed on a Landsat 9 HLS surface reflectance image), Terra/MODIS 1 km, Aqua/MODIS 1 km, Suomi NPP/VIIRS 375 m and NOAA-20/VIIRS 375 m (all displayed on respective MODIS and VIIRS corrected reflectance images), are marked in yellow. Temporal span for these consecutive images is approximately 3 hours. Why does the latency differ between the Landsat active fire detection data and the HLS Landsat imagery? Landsat active fire detection data are produced in collaboration with the USGS EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Daily Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI imagery for the continental United States, southern Canada, and northern Mexico are captured via the Landsat ground station at EROS. This imagery is formatted and pre-processed in near real-time by the USGS and further processed onsite at EROS using NASA algorithms to extract 30-meter active fire detection data and made available for ingest into FIRMS approximately 30 minutes after a satellite overpass. Landsat imagery in FIRMS is processed as part of the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel-2 (HLS) project to create BRDF-adjusted, 30-meter Landsat and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products. Generated separately as provisional/research NASA products, HLS currently has a latency requirement of < 7 days. Consequently, FIRMS users desiring to view Landsat active fire detection data in the context of HLS Landsat true and false color composite imagery are required to wait until the processing of the HLS imagery is complete and made available in FIRMS. The HLS imagery is currently processed and available in FIRMS 2-4 days after acquisition, which is less than the current HLS processing latency requirement. Opportunities to reduce the latency of HLS imagery processing and its availability in FIRMS will continue to be assessed by NASA and implemented if possible. Back to top FIRMS Fire Map Can I download the fire data from the FIRMS Fire Map? Active fire data are not currently available for download via Fire Map. However, active fire locations from MODIS and VIIRS are available for download for the last 24 hours, last 48 hours, and last 7 days on the Active Fire Data page. Older MODIS and VIIRS data can be obtained through the Archive Download Tool . How can I share what I see in the Fire Map viewer with others? You can create a customized view of imagery and geospatial data in the Fire Map viewer focused on a particular area of interest and share it with others as a PNG, JPG, GIF, or GeoTIFF image. To save and share an image of your map, click the screenshot icon at the bottom of the viewer and select your preferred option. Alternatively, you can create a unique URL for your customized view to share via email or social media by clicking the share icon at the bottom of the viewer. What are the different sources of fire data in Fire Map? See What are the different sources of data in FIRMS? What does today vs 24 hours mean? \"Today\" will show active fire detection data from 0000 GMT to present. “24 hours” will display active fire detection data from 0000 GMT yesterday to present. What is the best way to view smoke in Fire Map? To view smoke add one of the corrected reflectance layers from MODIS or VIIRS from \"backgrounds\". In addition, you could add the OMPS Aerosol Index and OMPS Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) from the \"overlays\" section. OMPS AI detects and measures the density of smoke and suspended particles in the vertical air column in the atmosphere. Typical values of the aerosol index range from 0 to 5 and indicate dust storms or biomass burning smoke located in the lower troposphere (1-3 km). For AI values significantly higher than 5, use the OMPS Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) layer. Larger AI values between 5 and 10 usually indicate dense smoke from intensely burning fires that reach higher in the troposphere. Once the AI gets above 10, the smoke has likely been produced from a pyroCb event, with dense smoke lofted into the upper troposphere and, often, into the stratosphere. The Aerosol Index layer is useful for identifying and tracking smoke from wildfires or biomass burning events as well as dust from desert dust storms and the long-range transport of volcanic ash from volcanic eruptions. Values of 5.0 indicate heavy concentrations of aerosols that could reduce visibility or impact human health. Back to top Email Alerts Can you notify me when a fire occurs in my area of interest? We have developed a global fire email alert system to notify users when a fire occurs in or near a specified area of interest, country, or protected area. You can subscribe to receive near-real time, daily, or weekly email alerts in English, Spanish, or French. To subscribe or learn more about the email based alert system, please see the FIRMS Email Alerts page. Do you provide mobile/cell phone text messages? No. We do not currently provide SMS text messages. In the past, we helped develop such a service in collaboration with ESKOM and CSIR Meraka in South Africa for the protection of power lines in remote areas from wildfires by informing operators in the field about fire events in near-real time.

I have received a CSV file as part of my Email Alert, can I add it as a layer in a Desktop GIS software? A CSV or Comma Separated Value file, is a text file in which separate fields are delimited by commas. This type of file can be used to store simple tabular data efficiently, minimizing file size. CSV files are easily opened with DB administration software such as PostgreSQL or MS Access, or by spreadsheet software such as MS Excel. This type of file can also be used to easily plot point data on desktop GIS software, given, as the active fire data does, that the tabular data contain X and Y coordinate information. The active fire data contains latitude and longitude location coordinates and the attributes of the detected fires. FIRMS US/Canada Why was FIRMS US/Canada developed? FIRMS US/Canada is the result of an agreement between the U.S. Forest Service and NASA to modernize the Forest Service's distribution of active fire information by leveraging the LANCE's web-based active fire mapping tools and capabilities for disseminating data, products and services. The significance of this NASA-Forest Service partnership goes beyond the creation of FIRMS US/Canada. It establishes a single, authoritative source of near real-time fire mapping, visualization, and geospatial data products and information for the United States and Canada jointly supported and enabled by both agencies. This enhanced cooperation will boost the availability of selected contextual geospatial data to increase the utility of near real-time fire geospatial data products, as well as increase opportunities, under the auspices of LANCE, to evaluate and integrate additional sources of NASA, NOAA, and international space agency satellite data of value to the user community.

What specific areas are covered by FIRMS US/Canada? FIRMS US/Canada includes coverage for the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Due to the geographic extent of these areas of interest, Mexico and Caribbean countries are also included. What are the differences between FIRMS Global and FIRMS US/Canada? Just like FIRMS, FIRMS US/Canada provides active fire data generally within 3 hours of a satellite observation from MODIS aboard NASA’s Aqua and Terra satellites and VIIRS aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites. Imagery is typically available within 3 to 4 hours and can be viewed on the interactive Fire Map application. In addition, FIRMS US/Canada meets the new Forest Service requirements by offering additional contextual layers and enhancements, including classifying fires to show time since detection to depict active fire fronts, incident locations and other information for current large fires in the US and Canada. FIRMS US/Canada provides current and historical corrected reflectance imagery from NASA and NOAA satellites, U.S. and Canada administrative ownership boundaries, daily fire danger forecasts, and current National Weather Service fire weather watch and red flag warning areas. What is the source for the USA Active Fires layer and what information does it provide? The USA Active Fires layer is based on information from the Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information (IRWIN) service maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior Office of Wildland Fire. IRWIN harvests and integrates information from numerous federal, state, and local wildfire reporting systems in near real-time to provide a single source of current information about all reported wildfire incidents. The USA Active Fires layer displays the location of current wildfires greater than 100 acres (40 hectares) in size and selected descriptive information, including fire name, latest reported size, and date/time of ignition. The displayed wildfire location is typically based on the identified or assumed point of origin of the fire. What is the source of the Canada Active Fires layer and what information does it provide? The Canada Active Fires layer is based on information from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System Active Wildfires dataset coordinated and maintained by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC) and Natural Resources Canada . Reported wildfire locations are updated and provided daily by partner provincial and territorial fire management agencies and Parks Canada. The Canada Active Fires layer displays the location of current wildfires greater than 100 acres (40 hectares) in size and selected descriptive information, including fire name/ID, latest reported size, and date/time of ignition. Where can I get more information about current wildfires in the U.S. and Canada? Additional information about current large wildfires in the United States can be found in the Incident Management Situation Report published by the National Interagency Coordination Center . Additional information about current large wildfires in Canada can be found in the National Fire Situation Report published by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC) . What is the source for USA Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings and what do they mean? The National Weather Service (NWS) is the source for fire weather watches and red flag warnings. A fire weather watch or red flag warning is issued by local/regional NWS forecast offices when the combination of dry fuels and weather conditions in designated NWS fire weather zones support extreme fire danger. Criteria for fire weather watches and red flag warnings vary by NWS office, but are typically based on the presence of fuel characteristics favorable for large fire growth, as determined by the land management agencies, and NWS-established critical thresholds for temperature, sustained winds, and relative humidity. Fire weather watches are issued up to 72 hours before these conditions are expected to occur while red flag warnings are issued when these conditions are expected to occur or are occurring within the next 24 hours. A similar layer for Canada is currently not available. What is the source for the USA Forecasted Fire Danger layer and what information does it provide? The Forecasted Fire Danger layer is based on the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS), which produces several components and indexes (e.g., ignition probability, fire rate of spread, etc.) that collectively describe current and potential fire danger conditions. Daily forecasted fire danger updates are used by wildland fire management agencies to assess current fire danger at local and national levels and inform decisions on an area’s fire protection needs. NFDRS fire danger is expressed as an adjective class rating that normalizes rating classes across different fuel models, indexes, and station locations. What is the source for the Canada Forecasted Fire Danger layer and what information does it provide? The Canada Fire Danger forecast layer is a relative index of how easy it is to ignite vegetation, how difficult a fire may be to control, and how much damage a fire may do. These ratings, updated and mapped daily, are based on the effects of fuel moisture and weather conditions on fire behavior as determined by the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System . Fire danger conditions are classified by the provincial and territorial fire management agencies and the choice and interpretation of classes may vary between provinces. What is the source for the United States wildfire perimeters and what does it display? The US Fire Perimeter layer displays the extent of current wildfires based on perimeter data from National Incident Feature Service (NIFS) maintained by the National Interagency Fire Center. Incident management teams for individual wildfire incidents are the source for these data. Input data/information sources for routine perimeter updates conducted by incident management teams, as well as the update frequency, can vary. How do I interpret/use wildfire perimeter data in the context of satellite active fire detection data? Wildfire perimeters for individual fires are typically updated once daily using relatively large scale data (airborne infrared flights, airborne or terrestrial GPS, etc.), but may be updated more or less frequently in particular circumstances. MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data introduce additional factors that can contribute spatial and temporal alignment between these data and perimeters for ongoing wildfire incidents. These factors include: Timing of satellite observations: MODIS and VIIRS are onboard polar-orbiting satellite platforms that do not provide persistent observations. They only detect the location and extent of active fires at the time of a satellite overpass. This may result in gaps in active fire detection data within perimeters. Properties of fire activity and active fire detection data resolution: The size and intensity of fires at the time of a satellite overpass, including small, very hot fires and larger, smoldering fires, can both trigger fire detection algorithms. In both conditions, the detected fire activity will be indicated at the spatial resolution of the thermal bands (375 m for VIIRS and 1 km for MODIS). In other words, a small, intense fire occupying a fraction of the pixel or a broader, cooler-burning fire occupying most of the pixel will both be represented as a fire at the spatial resolution of the data. This typically results in cumulative active fire detection data overestimating the size of a wildfire and not aligning with the perimeter boundaries. Satellite observation conditions: Atmospheric conditions, including clouds and heavy smoke, can partially or fully obscure fire activity at the time of a satellite overpass and hinder its detection. This omission of potentially detected fire activity can result in gaps in active fire detection data within perimeters. Additionally, the view geometry becomes more distorted with increasing distance from the nadir of the satellite observation. As a result, active fire detections in pixels towards the outer edges of the satellite view swath will be shifted/displaced outwards and fall outside the wildfire perimeter. Are additional capabilities planned for FIRMS US/Canada? Yes. The beta release of FIRMS US/Canada was completed in January 2021. Ongoing development activities include introduction of more remote sensing layers in the fire map viewer, particularly additional sources of near real-time satellite imagery and fire-relevant science data products, and enhancements to data downloads and user-defined fire alerts. More about the Ultra Real-Time (URT) and Real-Time (RT) data in FIRMS Ultra Real-Time (URT) MODIS and VIIRS active fire detections are available for the US and Canada. These data are compiled from multiple direct readout ground stations in CONUS as part of a partnership with Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. MODIS and VIIRS micro granules collected via direct broadcast are processed in seconds and made available in FIRMS in a matter of 1-2 minutes of satellite observation. The attributes of these URT data have a \"version\" ending in URT. (To obtain the attributes, zoom in and click on a fire in FIRMS Map viewer). Real-Time (RT) MODIS active fire detections are available through Direct Broadcast stations that process the data after the overpass has occurred. These data are generally available in FIRMS 20-25 minutes after satellite observation. See the Questions about Real-Time (RT) and Ultra Real-Time (URT) active fire data section for more information. Additional direct readout ground stations are being incrementally added to FIRMS. These additions will further increase the availability of URT MODIS and VIIRS data for North America collected from Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP and NOAA-20.

Smith Oct 27, 2022 Image This screen capture from FIRMS shows Landsat active fire imagery of the Double Creek Fire in Oregon on September 10, 2022.

Credit: NASA LANCE. NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ) was developed in 2007 to provide near real-time active fire data to natural resource managers generally within three hours of satellite observation. Since its inception, the majority of these data have come from two instruments: the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) aboard the joint NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) and NOAA-20 satellites. The importance of MODIS and VIIRS to the detection and monitoring of wildland fire is due in large part to the frequency of their observations. The MODIS instruments aboard Terra and Aqua and the VIIRS instruments aboard Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 view the entirety of Earth’s surface every 1 to 2 days. These repeated and timely observations provide wildfire response teams and natural resource managers with a wealth of data they can use to detect new fires, track the growth of known fires in near real-time, and assess the impacts of large burns. However, in the context of satellite remote sensing, there is an inverse relationship between temporal resolution (or revisit time) and spatial resolution; meaning that what is gained in temporal resolution is lost in spatial resolution, and vice versa . Neither MODIS nor VIIRS are exempt from this relationship. Therefore, although MODIS and VIIRS offer impressive temporal resolution, their spatial resolution—1 kilometer for MODIS and 375 meters for VIIRS—is considered rather coarse by most standards. To address this trade-off, FIRMS recently added a new near real-time Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies ( LFTA ) product for continental U.S., the southern half of Canada, and the northern half of Mexico that offers high-resolution, 30-meter active fire detection data within 30 to 60 minutes of observation. \"Users value higher spatial resolution data. They really gravitated to the VIIRS 375-meter near real-time active fire data relative to MODIS because of its higher spatial fidelity, while still providing comprehensive coverage and multiple revisits on a daily basis,” said Brad Quayle, Remote Sensing and GIS specialist with the USDA Forest Service's Geospatial Technology and Applications Center ( GTAC ). “Although Landsat does not provide the comprehensive daily coverage of MODIS or VIIRS, its spatial fidelity is a tremendous improvement and provides the ability to detect and more precisely locate fire activity, at least for the areas imaged on a given day.” Dr. Morgan Crowley, Fire Research Scientist with Canadian Forest Service's WildFireSat Mission , agrees and calls the addition of Landsat active fire data in FIRMS “exciting,” as it increases FIRMS’ utility to the fire science community. Image An artist’s rendition of the Landsat 9 satellite in orbit. The LFTA product is based on multispectral imagery acquired by the Operational Land Imagers ( OLI ) aboard the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites. The OLI’s 30-meter resolution provides active fire detection data with 1,000 and 160 times finer spatial resolution than MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. Credit: USGS. “Landsat active fire hotspots provide fine spatial scale information that is useful for contextualizing sub-daily observations from the other products like MODIS, VIIRS, and Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel (HLS),” she said. “Additionally, there is now a greater opportunity to combine the fine spatial scale hotspots from Landsat with the fine temporal scale hotspots from the existing sources using one seamless pipeline when accessing data in FIRMS.” The LFTA product is based on multispectral imagery acquired by the Operational Land Imagers ( OLI ) aboard the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites. The OLI’s 30-meter resolution provides active fire detection data with 1,000 and 160 times finer spatial resolution than MODIS and VIIRS, respectively, and its enhanced capabilities allow it to detect active fires as small as approximately four-square meters during the day. Nighttime detection of similar fire activity, when available, improves to an area as small as 1-square meter. “The resolution of MODIS and VIIRS bands used for fire detection are relatively coarse and a fire detection can be triggered by a relatively small, intensely burning and isolated fire within the pixel or from a fire burning more broadly across the extent of the pixel,” Quayle said. “The spatial fidelity of Landsat active fire detection data and its use in the context of MODIS and VIIRS allow users to not only validate those coarser resolution detections, but more precisely locate fire activity, such as the smaller, isolated, but intense fires that cannot be reliably discerned from coarser resolution imagery and derived data.” Such improvement in the ability to pinpoint ignitions is of significant benefit to fire managers. “FIRMS is useful for active fire monitoring as it provides hotspot data in an easy-to-use platform in a rapid operational timeline,” Crowley said. “Having Landsat data now available means that fire managers will have access to more detailed hotspot points which could be useful for looking at fire lines, nighttime burning, and small-scale ignitions and fires.” Further, the LFTA product’s low latency means that these Landsat data are available to users much sooner than the HLS data products provided through FIRMS, which require approximately two days of processing after acquisition. “The LFTA product is currently provided for most of North America in near real-time, within 30 to 60 minutes after satellite overpass,” Quayle said. \"Having these data available at this low latency thanks to the support of the NASA and USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Data Center greatly increases their value to the user community.” With the OLI aboard both Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, approximately 15% of the continental U.S. is imaged on a daily basis. That may not sound like much, but Quayle says it is enough to provide somewhat significant coverage for strategic fire monitoring purposes. “When it images ongoing incidents on a given day, the LFTA product is going to be a helpful resource,” he said. Quayle acknowledges that having Landsat active fire detection data captured at the temporal resolution and geospatial coverage provided by MODIS and VIIRS would be ideal. Landsat satellites do not provide such comprehensive global coverage on a daily basis because, unlike VIIRS and MODIS, OLI has a much narrower swath width of 185 kilometers, so it requires 16 days to completely image Earth's surface. The relatively large swath widths of MODIS and VIIRS allow them to provide comprehensive satellite observations and acquire active fire detection data for the entire globe each day. So, OLI can only provide partial coverage of large geographic areas. However, since the orbits of the Landsat 8 ad 9 satellites are 8 days out of phase, the revisit time for a particular location is every 8 days. Users can determine the time and location of Landsat observations for a selected date by consulting the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 orbit tracks on the FIRMS fire maps. Image This graphic provides an example of a 185 km Landsat 9 OLI swath (red) compared to a 2,330 km Terra MODIS swath (orange). Terra MODIS can easily image the entire continental U.S. daily in three consecutive orbits. However, Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI each require multiple orbits over 16 days to provide the same coverage. Credit: NASA LANCE. Quayle also noted that the temporal resolution of routine daytime Landsat observations may be improved by requesting that the USGS’s Earth Resources Observation and Science ( EROS ) Center arrange nighttime OLI imagery collections for targeted areas when it can feasibly be done within the confines of current Landsat science and mission priorities. “This can potentially improve the temporal resolution of the Landsat active fire product to about four days for particular incidents,” Quayle said. “There is also the potential to use additional satellite sensors with spatial and spectral resolution similar to Landsat's OLI, but relatively better temporal resolution. Use of the combined observations of Landsat OLI and these other sensors could reduce the temporal resolution to as little as 1-2 days.” Expanding the extent of the operational NRT LFTA product, which, as noted earlier, is currently limited to the continental U.S., the southern half of Canada, and the northern half of Mexico, is more of a challenge. “Currently, the extent of the operational near real-time product is limited to the area of Landsat direct broadcast data collection coverage provided by the Landsat Ground Station EROS, which is located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota,” Quayle said. “This covers all of the continental U.S., the southern half of Canada, and the northern half of Mexico. To expand near real-time Landsat active fire detection coverage to other areas of the globe will require investment of time and resources to implement similar operational data streams at other Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 ground stations.” Nevertheless, the feasibility of including additional ground stations for North America and elsewhere is currently being investigated. The LFTA product is collaboratively produced by NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ), the University of Maryland , the U.S. Forest Service, and EROS. It was created at the request of NASA and the U.S. Forest Service, who asked EROS to develop a near real-time data processing framework that provides Level 1 terrain-corrected Landsat OLI imagery, which is then processed further with NASA science data algorithms to generate the Level-2 30-meter resolution active fire data product. This methodology produces the data that are imported directly into FIRMS and negates the need for NASA and the U.S. Forest Service to download numerous scenes of Landsat data for subsequent staging and processing. “We coordinated with the Landsat Team at EROS to discuss possibilities about the availability of low latency Landsat OLI imagery,” said Quayle. “They have been very accommodating to our request and developed an optimized near real-time processing stream to provide terrain corrected OLI imagery about 30 minutes after an overpass.” Currently, the Landsat active fire data reach back to June 2022. Although the processing of earlier acquisitions by Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 is possible, Quayle said there are no plans to provide them in FIRMS at this time. Users should be aware that the LFTA product lacks fire characterization information, such as estimates of a fire’s radiative power or heat energy, and that each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a 30-m pixel containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies. Therefore, the location provided for each detection is the center point of the pixel and not necessarily the coordinates of the actual fire. Despite these limitations and its 8-day revisit time, this low latency product gives operational fire managers and fire scientists quicker access to more precise, higher-resolution data. “For active fire management purposes, the more timely the data, the greater its value. Yes, the temporal resolution is currently the greatest limitation, but until now, the bigger limitation in the operational use of the Landsat active fire data product was its latency—the availability of the source Landsat OLI imagery after satellite observation,” Quayle said. “Without the partnership and substantial contributions of EROS, the operational availability and potential value of this product would never be realized.” About FIRMS FIRMS was developed in 2007 by the University of Maryland, with funds from NASA’s Applied Sciences Program and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO ), to provide near real-time active fire locations to natural resource managers that faced challenges obtaining timely satellite-derived fire information. FIRMS US/Canada, which launched in January 2021, was developed through an agreement between the U.S. Forest Service's GTAC and NASA to modernize and optimize the U.S. Forest Service's distribution of active fire information by leveraging LANCE's web-based active fire mapping tools and capabilities for disseminating data, products, and services. Like the original FIRMS, FIRMS US/Canada provides active fire imagery that can be viewed on an interactive fire map and current and historical corrected reflectance imagery from NASA and NOAA satellites. It also meets recently developed U.S. Forest Service requirements by offering additional contextual layers and enhancements, including the depiction of active fire fronts complete with time-since-detection information, incident locations, ownership boundaries for current large fires in the U.S. and Canada, and National Weather Service fire weather forecasts and red flag warning areas.

Along with their destructive power, they also are a vital component of forest growth, ecological succession, and soil nutrient enhancement. NASA provides datasets and tools for assessing and managing wildfires before, during, and after an event. Image Wildfires emitted 1.76 billion metric tonnes (equivalent to more than 1.9 billion tons) of carbon globally in 2021, according to data from the European Union's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Credit: U.S. Forest Service. Wildfires are an essential process connecting terrestrial systems to the atmosphere and climate, and are an integral component of ecological succession, plant germination, and soil enhancement. Along with these beneficial aspects, they also emit vast quantities of carbon into the atmosphere along with aerosols and other particles that can impact health, restrict visibility, and contribute to global climate change. This Data Pathfinder is designed to help guide you through the process of selecting and using datasets applicable to wildfires, with guidance on resolutions and direct links to the data sources. If you are new to remote sensing, the What is Remote Sensing? Backgrounder provides a good overview. In addition, NASA's Applied Remote Sensing Training Program (ARSET) provides numerous training modules, including Fundamentals of Remote Sensing . If you have specific questions about how to use data, tools, or resources mentioned in this Data Pathfinder, please visit the Earthdata Forum . Here, you can interact with other data users and NASA subject matter experts on a variety of Earth science research and applications topics. An Overview of Wildfire The number, severity, and overall size of wildfires has increased , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, through contributing factors including extended drought, the build-up of fuels, past fire management strategies, invasive species targeting specific tree species, and the spread of residential communities into formerly natural areas. In 2021, 58,985 wildfires were reported across the U.S. that consumed 7,125,643 acres , according to the 2021 Annual Report by the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC), which coordinates the mobilization of resources for wildland fire and other incidents throughout the U.S. But wildfires also have a human component. The NICC report notes that wildfires destroyed almost 6,000 structures in 2021, including 3,577 residences, 2,225 minor structures, and 237 commercial or mixed residential structures. Data collected by sensors aboard orbiting satellites, carried aboard aircraft, or installed on the ground provide a wealth of data that can be used to assess conditions before a burn, track the movement of a wildfire in near real-time, and assess the environmental impact of an historic burn. NASA provides numerous datasets, tools, and other resources that can be used to investigate, track, and assess wildfires, all of which are available without restriction under NASA's open data policy. Common Measurements at a Glance Datasets referenced in this Data Pathfinder are from sensors shown in the table below and is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all sensors or missions producing data relevant to wildfires. Some of these datasets are available through NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ). LANCE data products are available generally within three hours of a satellite observation, which allows for near real-time (NRT) monitoring and decision making. If low-latency is not a primary concern, users are encouraged to use standard science products, which are produced using the best available calibration, ancillary, and ephemeris information.

Fire Forecasting Many factors contribute to the intensity and spread of a fire, including vegetation health, precipitation, etc. Post-Fire Impacts Once a fire burns through an area, there are many potential impacts, such as loss of vegetation, landslide potential, runoff, and more. Connection of Sustainable Development Goals to Wildfires The Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a blueprint for a sustainable future for all of Earth’s inhabitants. The SDGs are part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , an international plan signed by all United Nations (UN) member states in 2015 and underpinned by the foundational components of People, Planet, and Prosperity. The 17 SDGs in the Agenda are made up of 169 objectives that include specific social, economic, and environmental targets. These targets provide a blueprint for developing a more sustainable global future. Data acquired remotely by sensors aboard satellites and aircraft or installed on the ground play a unique role in tracking the progress toward achieving the SDGs. These remotely sensed Earth observations provide consistent and continuous information on the state of Earth processes and their change over time. These data also are integral components of socioeconomic metrics that provide a measure of how humans co-exist with the environment and the stresses they encounter through natural and human-caused changes to the environment. NASA Earth observation data are available without restriction to all data users, a policy that is being adopted by other international space agencies and one that reduces the cost of monitoring the SDGs and provides developing countries a means to acquire and utilize these data for other policy-making purposes. NASA’s datasets are organized by topics that help users to locate, access, and apply relevant and complementary datasets for each SDG. The Wildfire Data Pathfinder addresses (but is not limited to) the following SDGs: SDG SDG Goals Relevant to Wildfires Image Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere Target 1.5: By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters Image Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture Target 2.4: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production; that help maintain ecosystems; that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding, and other disasters; and that progressively improve land and soil quality Image Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable Target 11.5: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations Image Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries Target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning Target 13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning The opportunities to connect NASA data to the SDGs are infinite; therefore, the datasets included in specific Data Pathfinders are not intended to be comprehensive. Additionally, NASA datasets are not official indicators for SDG monitoring and decision-making but are complementary.

Back to top of Tools section AppEEARS AppEEARS , available through NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), offers a simple and efficient way to access and transform geospatial data from a variety of federal data archives. AppEEARS enables users to subset geospatial datasets using spatial, temporal, and band/layer parameters. Two types of sample requests are available: Point samples, for geographic coordinates Area samples, for spatial areas via vector polygons Performing Area Extractions After choosing to request an area extraction, you will be taken to the Extract Area Sample page where you will specify a series of parameters that are used to extract data for your area(s) of interest. Spatial Subsetting Define your region of interest in one of three ways: Upload a vector polygon file in shapefile format (you can upload a single file with multiple features or multipart single features). The .shp, .shx, .dbf, or .prj files must be zipped into a file folder to upload. Upload a vector polygon file in GeoJSON format (can upload a single file with multiple features or multipart single features). Draw a polygon on the map by clicking on the Bounding box or Polygon icons (single feature only). Select the date range for your time period of interest. Specify the range of dates for which you wish to extract data by entering a start and end date (MM-DD-YYYY) or by clicking on the Calendar icon and selecting dates a start and end date in the calendar.

Back to top of Tools section Soil Moisture Visualizer The Soil Moisture Visualizer tool at NASA's Oak Ridge National Laboratory DAAC (ORNL DAAC) integrates in-situ, airborne, and remote sensing data from a variety of soil moisture datasets covering North America into an easy-to-use platform (read more about this tool at Soil Moisture Data Sets Become Fertile Ground for Applications ). This integration helps to validate and calibrate the data, and provides spatial and temporal data continuity. It also facilitates exploratory analysis and data discovery for different groups of users. The Soil Moisture Visualizer offers the capability to geographically subset and download time series data in .csv format. For more information on the available datasets and use of the visualizer, see the Soil Moisture Visualizer Guide . To use the visualizer, select a dataset of interest under Data. Depending on the dataset chosen, the visualizer provides the included latitude/longitude or an actual site location name and data collection relative time frames. Upon selection of the parameter, the tool displays a time series with available datasets. All measurements are volumetric soil moisture. Surface soil moisture is the daily average of measurements at 0–5 cm depth, and root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is the daily average of measurements at 0–100 cm depth. The visualizer also provides data sources for download. Image The Soil Moisture Visualizer allows users to compare soil moisture measurements from multiple sources (figure legends, top left and bottom right) at the same location. In this screenshot, Level 4 Root Zone Soil Moisture (L4 RZSM) data from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Observatory are shown with data from in situ sensors across the 9-kilometer Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) grid cell encompassing the Tonzi Ranch Fluxnet site in the Sierra Nevada foothills of California. Daily precipitation values for the site (purple spikes) are also provided for reference. Credit: ORNL DAAC. Back to top of Tools section MODIS/VIIRS Subsetting Tools Suite ORNL DAAC also has several MODIS and VIIRS Subset Tools for subsetting data. With the Global Subset Tool, you can request a subset for any location on Earth and receive this subset as GeoTIFF and in text format, including interactive time-series plots and more. Specify a site by entering the site's geographic coordinates and the area surrounding that site, from one pixel up to 201 x 201 km. From the available datasets, you can specify a date and then select from MODIS Sinusoidal Projection or Geographic Lat/Long. Note: An Earthdata Login is required to request data. With the Fixed Subsets Tool, you can download pre-processed subsets for more than 3,000 field and flux tower sites for validation of models and remote sensing products. The goal of the Fixed Sites Subsets Tool is to prepare summaries of selected data products for the community to characterize field sites. It includes sites from networks such as NEON, ForestGeo, PhenoCam, and LTER that are of relevance to the biodiversity community. With the Web Service, you can retrieve subset data (in real-time) for any location(s), time period, and area programmatically using a REST web service. Web service client and libraries are available in multiple programming languages, allowing integration of subsets into users' workflow.

Back to top of Tools section Sentinel Toolbox The ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-1 Mission consists of two satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments operating at a C-Band frequency. The satellites orbit 180° apart, and together image the entire Earth every six days. SAR is an active sensor that can penetrate cloud cover and vegetation canopy, and also observe at night. Therefore, it is ideal for flood inundation mapping. It also provides useful information to detect changes in land position after an earthquake, volcanic eruption, or landslide. SAR data are very complex to process; however, ESA has developed a Sentinel-1 Toolbox to aid with processing and analysis of Sentinel-1 data. For more information on active sensors like SAR, see What is Remote Sensing? ; for more information about SAR specifically, see What is SAR? . Flood Inundation Mapping Image Effects of the SAR band on penetration of surfaces. The longer the wavelength, the deeper the penetration through most land types. Credit: The SAR Handbook , Dr. Franz Meyer. Before choosing data, it's important to determine which SAR wavelength band meets your needs, as radar signals penetrate deeper as the sensor wavelength increases. This difference in penetration is due to the dielectric properties of a given medium, which dictate how much of the incoming radiation scatters at the surface, how much signal penetrates into the medium, and how much energy gets lost to the medium through absorption. Another important parameter to consider when choosing a SAR dataset is the polarization, or the direction in which the signal is transmitted or received: horizontally or vertically. Dual polarization, for example, refers to two different signal directions: horizontal/vertical and vertical/horizontal (HV and VH). Knowing the polarization from which a SAR image was acquired is important, as signals at different polarizations interact differently with objects on the ground and affect the recorded radar brightness in a specific polarization channel. Image Strong scattering in HH indicates a predominance of double-bounce scattering (e.g., stemmy vegetation, manmade structures), while strong VV relates to rough surface scattering (e.g., bare ground, water), and spatial variations in dual polarization indicate the distribution of volume scatterers (e.g., vegetation and high-penetration soil types such as sand or other dry porous soils). Credit: The SAR Handbook , Dr. Franz Meyer. Once you have downloaded the needed SAR data, the data must be calibrated to account for distortion. The objective in performing calibration is to create an image where the value of each pixel is directly related to the backscatter of the surface. Calibration takes into account radiometric distortion, signal loss as the wave propagates, saturation, and speckle. This process is critical for analyzing images quantitatively; it is also important for comparing images from different sensors, modalities, processors, and acquisition dates. Important note: DO NOT unzip the downloaded SAR file . Open the .zip file from within the Sentinel Toolbox. When you expand the Bands folder, you will see an amplitude and an intensity file for each polarization option. (The intensity band is a virtual one and is the square of the amplitude.) Open the amplitude file. Subset the data by zooming in to the area of interest and right-clicking on \"Spatial Subset from View.\" Calibration is done by following these steps: Radiometric calibration is performed by selecting Radar/Radiometric/Calibration (leave parameters as default). Geometric correction is done after radiometric calibration. This fixes geometric distortions due to slant range, layover, shadow, and foreshortening. Terrain correction can be performed by selecting Radar/Geometric/Terrain Correction/ Range-Doppler Terrain Correction. This requires a digital elevation model (within the processing parameters, SRTM is the default selection). You also can specify a map projection in the processing parameters. Speckle is another characteristic of SAR images that must be addressed. Speckle is the grey level variation that occurs between adjacent resolution cells, and creates a grainy texture. Within the Toolbox, speckle can be removed by selecting \"Radar/Speckle Filtering/Single Product Speckle Filter\" and then choosing a type of filter; \"Lee\" is one of the most common.

RAPT enables users to combine data layers to create community maps to inform preparedness, response, and recovery strategies. Credit: FEMA National Integration Center. The Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool ( RAPT ) created by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a GIS web-based app that offers a variety of data (i.e., census data, infrastructure locations, and hazards, including real-time weather forecasts, historic disasters and estimated annualized frequency of hazard risks) that may complement the NASA data in this Data Pathfinder. These datasets presented in RAPT enable federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial emergency managers and other community leaders to examine and mitigate wildfire risks for community resiliency and environmental justice planning/analysis. RAPT provides a number of resources for users to get familiar with using the tool: StoryMap User Guide Data Layers and Sources How-To Videos Back to top of Tools section Benefits and Limitations of Remote Sensing Data In determining whether or not to use remote sensing data, it is important to understand not only the benefits but also the limitations of these data. The U.S. is fortunate to have numerous ground-based measurements for assessing a wide range of environmental variables, including water storage, precipitation, particulate matter, and more. However, this is not the case in other countries—and even in some of the more remote areas of the U.S. Data acquired by sensors aboard satellites provide local, regional, and global coverage and are useful for observing areas that are inaccessible. Rapid processing of raw satellite data also enable events to be monitored in near-real time, allowing for a faster response. It is difficult for a single sensor to combine all desirable features into one instrument, and trade-offs are made by instrument designers. For example, to acquire observations with moderate to high spatial resolution (like the Operational Land Imager [OLI] aboard Landsat 8 or the OLI-2 aboard Landsat 9), a narrower swath is required. This, in turn, requires more time between observations of a given area. Finding a sensor with the spatio-temporal resolution capable of addressing your research, application, or decision-making needs is a crucial first step in using remotely sensed data. Passive instruments (those that use energy reflected or emitted from Earth for measurements) are not able to penetrate cloud or vegetation cover, which can lead to data gaps or a decrease in data utility, such as the inability to detect a fire or sense the radiative power of small fires. This is not the case when using data from active sensors, which send out a signal and measure the intensity of the returned signal. With satellite data, comparisons can be made using pre-event and post-event imagery, providing information on smoke and ash transport, burn severity, vegetation loss, and more. Incorporating satellite data with in-situ data (ground-based measurements) into modeling programs makes for an even more robust forecasting system.

These DAAC-unique tools have been developed by various EOS instrument teams, or by the DAACs and their data partners. Several categories of tools offer a wide range of functionality, from data discovery (search and order) to data use (visualization and analysis). Each category is given a brief description below. Many tools provide functionality overlapping multiple categories, for example subsetting, reprojection and data format conversion. Data visualization and analysis tools may also feature subsetting, regridding or mapping capabilities. Search and Order Tools Data discovery tools are available for users to quickly and efficiently find data products most useful to them, from simple text searches to more elaborate map-based searches with subsetting capability. Some tools combine search-and-order functions while others are stand-alone download applications. In some cases users can examine browse imagery prior to ordering to determine if search results meet user needs. Data Handling Tools (Read/Ingest, Format Conversion, Data Manipulation) Users can access data handling tools to perform a variety of functions. Some tools read HDF files and output the data to one or more types of formats e.g., NetCDF, GeoTIFF, jpg, binary, and Arc ASCII . Data manipulation capabilities include terrain correction (georectification), metadata extraction, data unpacking, and scaling. Tools in this section also let users filter data by various criteria; a number of these tools are also listed in the following section. Subsetting and Filtering Tools (Temporal, Spatial, Parameter, Channel) Subsetting and filtering tools allow users to find and access only those data of interest to them, i.e., for a specific geospatial location, time period, or geophysical parameter. For multispectral and multi-angle viewing instruments, data from particular spectral channels or viewing angles (cameras) can be subset and downloaded. For geospatial filtering, users can specify coordinates, select user defined regions from a map, or used pre-defined regions specified by the instrument teams or DAACs. Geolocation, Reprojection, and Mapping Tools Specific geolocation, reprojection, and mapping functions depend on particular instruments and their associated data tools. Capabilities include conversion from swath format to gridded data in a variety of map projections or gridded georeferenced images. Some tools allow importing data into Google Earth maps, and others allow conversion from one map projection (e.g., EASE-grid) to another. See Data Tools for a comprehensive list of DAAC provided tools.

Each year, forest fires consume millions of acres of land, destroying thousands of homes and properties in the Western United States and around the world. Fires like the 100,277-hectare Lutz Creek fire in British Columbia in August 2018 and the Camp Fire in California in November 2018, which burned more than 142,000 acres, exact a costly economic and human toll.

{"URL": "https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/unified-metadata-model-umm", "Content Type": "text/html", "Paragraphs": ["Unified Metadata Model (UMM) | Earthdata Skip to main content Unified Metadata Model (UMM) NASA's UMM is an extensible metadata model which provides a cross-walk for mapping between the EOSDIS CMR-supported metadata standards. Background NASA’s Common Metadata Repository ( CMR ) is a high-performance, high-quality repository for earth science metadata records that is designed to handle metadata at the Concept level. Collections and granules are common metadata concepts in the Earth Observation (EO) world, but this can be extended out to visualizations, parameters, documentation, services, and more. The CMR metadata records are supplied by a diverse array of data providers, using a variety of supported metadata standards, including: Initially, designers of the CMR considered standardizing all CMR metadata to a single, interoperable metadata format - ISO 19115. However, NASA decided to continue supporting multiple metadata standards in the CMR - in response to concerns expressed by the data provider community over the expense involved in converting existing metadata systems to systems capable of generating ISO 19115. In order to continue supporting multiple metadata standards, NASA designed a method to easily translate from one supported standard to another and constructed a model to support the process. Thus, the Unified Metadata Model (UMM) for NASA's Earth Observation System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) metadata was born as part of the EOSDIS Metadata Architecture Studies (MAS I and II) conducted between 2012 and 2013. Image What is UMM? UMM is an extensible metadata model which provides a cross-walk for mapping between CMR-supported metadata standards. Rather than create mappings from each CMR-supported metadata standard to each other, each standard is mapped centrally to UMM, thus reducing the number of translations required from n x (n-1) to 2n. Note: n is the number of CMR-supported metadata standards. An example of mappings among collection metadata standards is depicted in the diagram to the right. At the time of this writing, UMM provides mappings to and from: GCMD DIF10 for Collections via UMM-C ECHO 10 for Collections via UMM-C and ECHO 10 for Granules via UMM-G ISO19115-1 and ISO19115-2 Series for Collections via UMM-C GCMD SERF for Services via UMM-S How does UMM Work? UMM describes the metadata related to key EOSDIS concepts (such as collection or granule) using UMM metadata “profiles.” Each UMM profile is a document which provides a schema-agnostic representation of the elements necessary to provide high quality metadata for its related EOSDIS concept, and which maps those elements to each CMR-supported metadata standard. To date, there are seven profiles described in UMM: Summary information about current UMM profile status and content is shown in the table below. Where present, the content diagram shows subject-related groupings of elements within the associated profile. Note: Table above represents the status of UMM profiles as of December 2019. For more recent and detailed information, visit the Key CMR and UMM Documents Page . What Information is Contained in UMM Documentation? UMM documentation for each profile identifies required elements, constraints on those elements, optional elements, overall descriptions of the semantics of those elements, and guidance for how to develop and maintain high quality metadata. For each element defined in a UMM profile, there is an element specification, description, profile utilization, cardinality, analysis, specification of any conflicts that were identified by the unification process, a mapping to existing standards, examples, and future recommendations. An example of element documentation within the UMM-C profile is available for viewing. Approved UMM profile documents (highlighted green in the table above) can be accessed from the Key CMR and UMM Documents Page . How is UMM Governed? As with any metadata representation, evolution and improvement are critical to the success of UMM. NASA’s UMM profiles are revisited and updated at least once per year. Part of this update process is a formal change proposal and review workflow. The EOSDIS community may contribute requests for updates, changes, clarifications, and deprecations of elements in a UMM profile, which are then tracked as part of NASA’s metadata quality effort. Requests for modifications are documented and an impact analysis is conducted. Recommendations along with their supporting documentation are then put before a UMM review board consisting of EOSDIS community members and the ESDIS Standards Coordination Office (ESCO). After a review and commenting period, the UMM profile is updated to reflect approved changes and a new version is released. While it is understood that changes to a UMM profile can have an impact on existing systems and backward compatibility is highly valued, metadata quality is a critical aspect of UMM efforts and periodic updates are a way to ensure UMM is meeting end user needs and helping to drive EOSDIS metadata usage forward. To submit requests for updates, changes, clarifications, and/or deprecations of elements to UMM profiles, please send your request to Earthdata Support and it will be routed to the appropriate personnel.

About the CMR Metadata Curation Dashboard The CMR Metadata Curation Dashboard is used to curate NASA EOSDIS collection and granule level metadata in the CMR for correctness, completeness and consistency. A series of initial automated metadata quality checks are performed when ingesting a selected record into the tool, after which the record is available for manual review. Metadata reviewers perform manual quality checks in the tool, with the option to flag identified issues as high (red), medium (yellow), or low (blue) priority. Additionally, the tool allows reviewers to leave specific recommendations on how to resolve identified issues. Metrics are tracked for all of the data entered into the tool (e.g. number of high, medium, and low priority issues flagged) allowing for the generation of reports on the fly. Detailed reports can be generated for individual record reviews, which summarize the number of red, yellow and blue flagged elements along with recommendations made on how to resolve identified issues. Higher level reports, summarizing metrics across all records in the tool or from a certain data provider, can also be generated. Reports can be shared directly in the tool with other users."]},

Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Operations System (EDOS) NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Operations System (EDOS) captures high-rate science and engineering data from the EOS spacecraft and instruments , processes telemetry to generate and maintain a backup archive of Level 0 Science Data Products (raw satellite data) for the Terra , Aqua , and Aura missions. It removes telemetry artifacts, creates sets of non-overlapping raw data as sensed by the individual instruments over specific time intervals, and sends them to the appropriate Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). In the case of a data loss at any of the DAACs, the data can be recovered from the backup archive within EDOS. In the case of loss of a part of the backup level 0 data within EDOS, the corresponding data can be recovered from the appropriate DAAC. Level 0 data are provided by EDOS to a given DAAC as Production Data Sets or Expedited Data Sets for processing by the DAAC or an associated Science, Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS). The interface between control centers and ground stations for Terra, Aqua, and Aura is provided by NASA's EOS Real time Processing System (ERPS). ERPS provides ground services for data processing, distribution, and storage for low-rate return link data, and processing, delivery, and logging for forward link data conforming to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems ( CCSDS ) Recommendations for Space/Ground Data Communications. ERPS provides the capability to use Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for the transfer of real-time data between the NASA Goddard-based EOS Operations Center (EOC) and the remote ground terminals. Flight Operations Segment (FOS) NASA's Flight Operations Segment (FOS) consists of the EOS Operations Center (EOC) located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and a number of Instrument Support Terminals (ISTs) at the instrument teams' facilities. The EOC controls Terra, Aqua, and Aura, provides mission planning and scheduling, and monitors health and safety of the spacecraft and instruments. It provides tools to coordinate observations from multiple instruments and develop conflict-free schedules, validate commands to assure safety, accommodate unplanned schedule changes, develop and provide mission timelines, and develop and implement contingency plans. The EOC interacts with the various elements of the ground systems and space network as necessary to send commands to the EOS spacecraft and to receive health and safety data from the spacecraft, and also interacts with the International Partners' instrument control centers for exchange of planning and command and control information. The EOC is implemented using a combination of commercial mission control systems and custom software developed as the EOS Mission Operations System (EMOS).

Principal investigators (PIs) and Science Teams (STs) develop and maintain the algorithms and product generation software and ensure science quality and integrity of the products. The Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are committed to archive and distribute all EOSDIS Standard Products. EOSDIS Standard Products: EOS Standard Products are internally consistent, well-calibrated records of observations of the Earth's geophysical properties. They are identified and defined by EOS investigators who have been selected through a competitive peer review process to develop algorithms and software for generating products from EOS observations. Products contain geophysical parameters and can be used for science research and application. A standard product file may require companion/support files to make data usable or to satisfy policy requirements. Examples include geolocation data files, browse image data, calibration and validation, higher-resolution data undergoing validation, and data quality metrics. Standard products are validated, QA and fully documented. Standard Products, as defined by their PIs, consist of geophysical measurements from various types of instruments. The products often depict geophysical measurements in various geographic projections, grid resolutions, parameter and time aggregates, and algorithm versions. As such, they may be represented by multiple product dataset collections. Information about the product collections archived at the DAACs are recorded in NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR). Lists of these collections have been extracted from the CMR to summarize the standard products that are currently available. Three lists, current as of August 5, 2020, are available below (NRT are not standard products, but are related): Standard Products available from Earth Observing System (EOS) missions (.xls) Standard Products available from Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 (.xls) Standard Products available from Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 (Amendment of Corrections to Original Version) (.xls) Near Real-Time (NRT) Products (.xls) Near Real-Time (NRT) Products (Amendment of Corrections to Original Version) (.xls) Descriptions of the spreadsheet column metadata and how to use these tables: Data Provider This metadata field describes DAACs and their personnel or internal groups responsible for originating, processing, archiving, and/or distributing the data and metadata. The name maps to one of the DAACs. Short Name and Version The collection short name and version is defined by the PI, ST, and Science Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS) in coordination with the DAAC. The short name and version ID combination are unique. Product Name This is the free-form title of the collection as defined by the PI, ST, and SIPS in coordination with the DAAC. It often includes the processing level, the geophysical parameter, the geographic or vertical map resolution, and the collection version. In some cases multiple collection names will be associated with a single standard product. The names may be used to indicate or suggest how their contents relate. For example, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) geolocation data files should be associated with the MODIS files having geophysical parameter names. Various reprojections, grid resolutions, or time aggregations may be stored in separate product collections. Processing Level Definitions from EOSDIS Terminology Specification 423-SPEC-002 (PDF): Level 0 (L0) : Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument or platform data at full resolution. Level 1A (L1A) : Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced, and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters, e.g., platform ephemeris, computed and appended but not applied to the Level 0 data. Level 1B (L1B) : Level 1A data that have been processed to sensor units. Level 2 (L2) : Derived geophysical variables at the same resolution and location as the Level 1 source data. Level 3 (L3) : Level 3 data products are variables mapped on uniform space-time grid scales. Level 4 (L4) : Level 4 data products are model output or results from analyses of lower level data, e.g., variables derived from multiple measurements. Spacecraft This metadata field describes the relevant on-orbit platform used to acquire the data. For products that incorporate data from multiple missions, we assign the spacecraft name to the EOS or partner spacecraft (e.g., Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, GCOM-W). Start Time Describes the time in which the dataset was acquired or when the measurements occurred for a specific collection. The start time can represent the beginning data time, a single data time, or the data time for the period covered by the collection. Reference The definition of EOS Standard Products was derived from the Earth Science Reference Handbook (Edited by Parkinson, Ward, King), 2006.

To this end, EOSDIS provides a spectrum of services: some services are intended for a diverse group of casual users, some are intended only for a select cadre of research scientists chosen by NASA's peer-reviewed competitions, and many fall somewhere in between. The primary services provided by EOSDIS are User Support, Data Archive, Management, and Distribution, Information Management, and Product Generation, all of which are managed by NASA's Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project. Two additional EOSDIS services, Spacecraft Command and Control and Data Capture and Telemetry Processing, are managed by NASA's Earth Science Mission Operations (ESMO) Project. EOSDIS services are described below. User Support The vast majority of people who interact with EOSDIS do so via NASA's Distributed Active Archive Centers ( DAACs ). The DAACs have User Support Services to assist users in data acquisition, search, access, and usage. While most of the interaction by users with EOSDIS is through human-computer interfaces or computer-to-computer interfaces, occasional consultation is needed with the User Support Services staff for assistance with specialized questions regarding the data or the system. The DAACs provide support services to users from both the public and private sectors, including research scientists, educators, students, users in public agencies responsible for operational applications such as weather forecasts and environmental monitoring, policy makers, and the public in general. Data Archive, Management, and Distribution A list of current EOSDIS data holdings is available through the links found in the Data section. This list includes data products derived from the satellite missions and scientific campaigns, along with other related data and information. EOSDIS stores all the standard products computed from NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) instruments during their mission life, and distributes requested data to users electronically (via networks). EOSDIS also stores and distributes data from non-EOS sources that are needed for EOS standard product generation. In addition, product generation algorithms, software, documentation, calibration data, engineering, and other ancillary data are stored and provided to users upon request. Sufficient information is stored about the system configuration history to be able to regenerate products in case of accidental or catastrophic loss. Access to the current suite of EOSDIS data holdings may be obtained via the DAACs. Information Management EOSDIS provides convenient mechanisms for locating and accessing products of interest. The \"look and feel\" of the system is intuitive and uniform across the multiple nodes from which EOSDIS can be accessed. EOSDIS facilitates collaborative science by providing extensible sets of tools and capabilities that allow investigators to provide access to special products (or research products) from their own computing facilities. EOSDIS provides middleware called Common Metadata Repository ( CMR ) that provides Application Programmer Interfaces ( APIs ) through which search and access software (clients) can be developed. Client interfaces permit users to access Earth science data archives, browse data holdings, select data products, and place data orders. These gateways provide access to EOSDIS data products plus other Earth science data; only the EOSDIS products include the EOS suite of metadata attributes and values to enhance search capabilities. In addition, specialized services at each of the DAACs can be accessed via their individual interfaces. Product Generation EOSDIS supports data product generation from EOS instrument observations. Algorithms and software for EOS data products are generated by EOS investigators as a part of their scientific studies. The algorithms and specifications for standard products are reviewed by NASA through a peer review process to ensure the completeness and consistency needed to satisfy the goals of NASA's EOS mission. Priorities for the processing and reprocessing needed to generate standard products depend on scientific requirements, technical considerations, and cost. Such priorities are determined by the respective instrument teams and EOS Project scientists based on recommendations from the national and international Earth science community. Spacecraft Command and Control EOSDIS performs planning and scheduling for spacecraft and instruments, as well as command and control. These functions include processing data acquisition requests, coordinating of multi-instrument observations, ensuring that the commands generated are valid and within resource constraints, monitoring and maintenance of the health and safety of spacecraft and instruments, analyzing spacecraft data, and maintaining a history of spacecraft and instrument operations. EOSDIS also provides appropriate interfaces to ensure command and control of International Partners' instruments aboard EOS spacecraft, and EOS instruments aboard non-EOS spacecraft. Data Capture and Telemetry Processing EOSDIS captures science data from all EOS spacecraft and processes them to remove telemetry errors, eliminate communication artifacts, and create Level 0 Standard Data Products that are \"raw\" data as measured by the instruments (see the Science Data Product Level Definitions ). Some EOS instruments are designated as prototype operational environmental monitoring instruments. The data from those instruments are made available within three hours of observation to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to support operational weather forecasts. For EOS instruments flying on non-EOS spacecraft, the EOS instrument data are captured by the respective ground systems and received by EOSDIS for higher-level data processing, archiving, and distribution.

The Earthdata website team will work to ensure that operational and end-user questions and issues are addressed by the appropriate team. The Earthdata website team will also work to ensure that planned or unplanned outages of EOSDIS systems are reported in a timely and accurate fashion. User Management EOSDIS uses the Earthdata Login to provide a simple, enterprise-level mechanism for user registration and user profile management for all users accessing data at the DAACs. The information provided by users when they register for Earthdata Login helps NASA better understand how our data are being used and the diverse needs of multiple user communities. This helps us prioritize improvements in data discovery, access, and usability. Registration also allows us to inform users with pertinent information such as the availability of new or updated data products, or data quality issues. In the future, it will allow for new value-added features and customized services resulting in a better user experience. User Support Tool EOSDIS maintains a centralized User Support Tool ( UST ) that is used to manage and resolve user requests throughout EOSDIS. Users can submit requests via a web form, or via email to a centralized user support tool. Once the request enters the tool, it is routed to the specific department within EOSDIS that is best suited to handle the request. Staff within that department then interacts directly with the user via email to resolve the user’s request. As new capabilities are added to Earthdata additional departments can be added.

To meet these demands, NASA's Earth Science Data Systems ( ESDS ) Program is implementing a strategic vision to develop and operate multiple components of NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) in a commercial cloud environment. EOSDIS provides end-to-end capabilities for managing NASA Earth science data from satellites, aircraft, in-situ measurements, and other sources, and the migration of EOSDIS data into the Earthdata Cloud , the first and currently the largest cloud project at NASA. This migration benefits users by giving them new ways to access NASA’s collection of Earth science datasets, improves the efficiency of data systems operations, increases user autonomy, maximizes flexibility, and offers shared services and controls. The Earthdata Cloud is a key component of the ESDS Transform to Open Science ( TOPS ) program, which provides the visibility, advocacy, and community resources to support and enable the shift to open science. TOPS, in turn, is part of NASA’s Open-Source Science Initiative , which promotes the open sharing of software, data, and knowledge (algorithms, papers, documents, ancillary information) as early as possible in the scientific process. Data in the Cloud The Earthdata Cloud architecture went operational in July 2019 and, soon thereafter, key EOSDIS services , such as NASA's Common Metadata Repository ( CMR ) and Earthdata Search were deployed within it. Since then, efforts to increase the amount of data and services available in the cloud has continued. For example, NASA’s Global Imagery Browse Services ( GIBS ) is transitioning to the cloud and, as of January 2022, 5% of its total imagery layers (20% by volume), 5% of its ingest \"handlers\" (i.e., the code used to pull imagery from DAACs in an Intelligence Community Directive-compliant manner), and 80% of its on-premises imagery archive has been transferred to the cloud. (The system is expected to be 100% in the cloud by Fall/Winter 2022.) Further, many of NASA’s EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive Centers ( DAACs ) have made considerable progress moving the data archives they manage into the cloud. As February 2022, EOSIDS DAACs have migrated more than 1 Petabyte (PB) into the Earthdata Cloud, with more data being added weekly. Benefits to Data Users and the Scientific Community Moving EOSDIS data to the cloud has numerous benefits for data users and EOSDIS, including: Easy access to data: Data users will be able to access data directly in the cloud, making the need to download volumes of data unnecessary. (Note: Users will still have the ability to download data if they choose.) Rapid deployment: Users can bring their algorithms and processing software to the cloud and work directly with the data in the cloud, simplifying procurement and hardware support while expediting science discovery. Scalability: The size and use of the archive can expand easily and rapidly as needed. Flexibility: Mission needs can dictate options for selecting operating systems, programming languages, databases, and other criteria to enable the best use of mission data. Reduced redundancy: The use of a common infrastructure with cloud native services will reduce redundant tools and services, enable sharing, and enforce the use of community standards as well as uniform policies and processes. Cost effectiveness: EOSDIS and NASA pay only for the storage and services used. Along with scalability benefits, this allows the amount of storage or services to be continually adjusted to ensure that data and services are effectively provided at the lowest possible cost to NASA and EOSDIS. Note: Under NASA’s full and open data policy, all NASA data will continue to be free to access and download. This means that users will be able to employ these cloud-based EOSDIS-provided services to discover, search, access, and download data, at no cost. However, users who wish to store data in their own Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud instance or cloud storage, are responsible for covering those cost. For more information on this topic, see “ Understanding and Managing Costs in the AWS Cloud ,” one of several tutorials on how to get started in the AWS cloud. Earthdata Cloud also benefits the scientific community that uses NASA Earth science data for research. By making NASA data, algorithmic code, and metadata available in the cloud, the scientific processes of NASA researchers will become more transparent and their results more reproducible, which in turn lends clarity and validity to the scientific process. In addition, the use of standardized software and code makes it easier for new users to learn to interact with the data and become more involved in the scientific process. Background As of September 2021, Earthdata Cloud holds more than 59 PB of data. According to estimates from ESDS, that amount is expected to grow considerably in the coming years to more than 148 PB in 2023, 205 PB in 2024, and 250 PB in 2025. As the volume of data in the EOSDIS archive continues to grow, the EOSDIS archive’s data ingest rate is expected to increase dramatically along with it. By the end of the decade, the volume of data in the EOSDIS archive is expected to surpass 320 PB. This anticipated growth in both the data ingest rate, as well as the overall archive volume, poses an array of challenges for distributing and analyzing the data currently stored and disseminated through physical servers on-premises at EOSDIS DAACs. Therefore, for Earthdata Cloud to meet users’ needs, NASA's Earth Science Data and Information System ( ESDIS ) is working to ensure it provides services in several key areas, including: Data acquisition from data providers (such as NASA science teams). Data ingest: The system must support multi-mission and multi-discipline data ingest. Data validation and processing. Data archive: The system must preserve and protect NASA Earth observation data. Data distribution, including disaster recovery: The system must support distribution of data, subsetting, and visualization, and must be adaptable to future technologies. Metadata: The harvest, creation, and publication of dataset metadata to the CMR. Data management: The system must meet the development and execution of information lifecycle needs of NASA mission-based Earth science datasets. Metrics: Publication of metrics to the ESDIS Metrics System ( EMS ), which collects and organizes various metrics from the DAACs and other data providers. NASA’s agreement with AWS has resulted in collaborations to improve the discovery, access, and use of NASA science datasets; the creation of data storage and staging areas to facilitate the community evaluation of data products; and workshops to expand the use of cloud-computing resources. NASA’s collaboration with Google has led to investigations into the transfer, storage, and value of making large volumes of NASA science datasets available on the Google Cloud and Google Earth Engine; making NASA Earth Science data accessible to users via the Google Cloud Public Dataset search engine and Earth Engine Catalog; and growing NASA’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities through joint efforts with NASA’s Frontier Development Lab (FDL) Challenges and SpaceML projects. NASA’s partnership with Microsoft has launched investigations into the value of making high-value NASA science datasets available on Azure; cost and performance evaluations of data storage methods and technologies and support analytics; the exploration of strategies to enable cloud-based analytics to promote science in the cloud; and analysis of the approaches to build and share training datasets for AI at a scale. For example, NASA implemented Cumulus , which provides a range of functionality in the cloud, including data acquisition from providers (such as NASA science teams); data ingest, including validation and processing; the harvest, creation, and publication of dataset metadata to the CMR; the storage and distribution of data, including disaster recovery; and publication of metrics to the EMS, which collects and organizes various metrics from the DAACs and other data providers. Further, Cumulus is integrated with the NASA-Compliant General Application Platform (NGAP), a custom-built cloud optimized platform, which provides highly flexible cloud native infrastructure, NASA-compliant IT Security controls, networking services, and business cost control in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Moving the collective data archive from the DAACs into the cloud puts NASA Earth observation data “close to compute,” giving users improved access to data, the ability to use large datasets more efficiently, and the ability to conduct a broader range of research. This move will not change existing methods of user interaction with EOSDIS data, but it does require new methods of accessing NASA data that differs from on-premises platforms. Further, as more datasets migrate to the cloud, the DAACs will continue to serve as the gateways to EOSDIS data holdings and provide a wide range of support services for users. Earthdata Cloud Evolution As the volume of data from NASA missions increases, so will the need for data management and archive technologies that are adaptable and scalable. Earthdata Cloud possesses these attributes, which will serve NASA’s forthcoming, high-data-volume missions, such the upcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography ( SWOT ), which is scheduled for launch in 2022, and the NASA-Indian Space Research Organisation Synthetic Aperture Radar ( NISAR ) missions, which is expected to launch in 2023. NISAR is expected to add 85 TB of data to the EOSDIS archive each day and as much as 140 PB of data over its scheduled three-year lifespan. To accommodate this volume, NASA's Alaska Satellite Facility DAAC ( ASF DAAC ) is worked collaboratively with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to test and prototype ways of archiving and distributing NISAR data using the commercial cloud. This project, known as Getting Ready for NISAR ( GRFN ), is now complete and has successfully demonstrated key components for efficiently handling NISAR volumes in a commercial cloud. ASF DAAC is also archiving and distributing Sentinel-1 data from the European Commission’s Copernicus Program into NASA-managed cloud accounts. These missions are presenting NASA with unrivaled opportunities to further develop and test systems and architectures for providing improved data management and user access to the unprecedented volumes of data future Earth science missions are expected to generate. These missions are presenting NASA with unrivaled opportunities to further develop and test systems and architectures for providing improved data management and user access to the unprecedented volumes of data future Earth science missions are expected to generate. Achieving the Potential of Cloud Computing through Partnerships To capitalize on the benefits that cloud computing offers to the scientific community, ESDS’s Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team ( IMPACT ) program has executed Space Act Agreements (SAAs)— legal agreements between NASA and another party to work collaboratively on a project or technology—with private companies, including AWS, Google, and Microsoft. In the process, NASA is building a network of technical experts whose knowledge it can leverage for the benefit of Earth Science data users. For example: In addition, NASA is considering additional agreements with some additional companies—Esri, IBM, and Nvidia—to accelerate the development, delivery, and adoption of AI to further NASA’s science research and applications, explore new opportunities in cloud technologies that enable and accelerate open science, and collaboration on effective joint solutions promoting open science and a better experience for those who user NASA data. Continuing NASA’s Tradition of Free and Open Data NASA Earth science data have been freely openly and available to all users since EOSDIS became operational in 1994. Under NASA's full and open data policy , all NASA mission data (along with the algorithms, metadata, and documentation associated with these data) must be freely available to the public. This means that anyone, anywhere in the world, can access the more than 59 PB of NASA Earth science data without restriction. Further, since 2015, the data systems software developed through NASA awards and research and technology grants are available as open-source software, which means the software’s source code for is freely available for inspection, modification, and enhancement. This allows enabled software and code to be available more broadly and shared collaboratively with diverse groups to accelerate software development. The concept of open science builds on the philosophy and spirit of the open-source software movement, and endeavors to create a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the public to accelerate scientific research and understanding. As the term implies, open science aims to make scientific findings as transparent as possible by making all elements of a claimed discovery readily accessible, which enables results to be repeated and validated. Now, a new scientific paradigm—open-source science—is emerging from the open science concept. Open-source science takes these notions of openness and transparency even further by applying them to the entire scientific process. Its goal is to accelerate discovery by conducting science openly, from project initiation through implementation. The result is the inclusion of a wider, more diverse community in the scientific process as close to the start of research activities as possible, which engenders trust in the scientific process. It also represents a cultural shift that encourages collaboration and participation among practitioners of diverse backgrounds, including scientific discipline, gender, ethnicity, and expertise. Open-source science is more equitable science. Open-source science is a foundational objective of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and SMD's ESDS Program. Along with the wide dissemination and use of openly available Earth-observing data, the SMD promotes and facilitates the full and open sharing of all metadata, documentation, models, images, and research results achieved using these data and makes available the source code used to generate, manipulate, and analyze them. Open-source science will also be a key attribute of NASA’s Earth System Observatory ( ESO ), a new set of Earth-focused satellite missions that will work in tandem to provide a holistic view of Earth and collect key information to guide efforts related to climate change, natural hazard mitigation, fighting forest fires, and improving real-time agricultural processes. As part of its commitment to open-source science, NASA will make all ESO mission data, code, and supporting documents available as early in the mission life cycle as feasible. Given the expected high volume of ESO data, these data will be stored in Earthdata Cloud and tools will be provided for working with these data directly in the cloud environment. This strategy will expand the ability of global research teams to collaboratively work with and conduct research using more NASA Earth science data than ever before, and the result will be the availability of these data to a broader, more diverse global community of users with the attendant increase in opportunities for scientific discovery.

In other words, as spatial resolution increases, temporal resolution decreases and vice versa. For example, the VIIRS sensor onboard S-NPP and NOAA-20 has a swath width of 3,000 kilometers and each instrument images the entire surface of the Earth at least once daily. The swath width of MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua is narrower at 2,330 km providing slightly less than daily global coverage. However, the finest spatial resolution of active fire detection data that can be gleaned from VIIRS and MODIS at 375 meters and 1 kilometer, respectively, are considered coarse resolution data by most definitions. In comparison to VIIRS and MODIS, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard both Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 provides active fire detections at relatively finer spatial resolution (30 meters) ( please see the related NASA FIRMS blog entry that introduces the Landsat active fire product ) . Unlike VIIRS and MODIS, OLI has a much narrower swath width of 185 kilometers. The swath of OLI is less than 1/10 th the width of a MODIS swath and provides much lower temporal resolution/sampling by comparison (Fig 1). Figure 1 - Example of a 185 km Landsat 9 OLI swath (red) compared to a 2,330 km Terra MODIS swath (orange). Terra MODIS can easily image the entire continental US daily in three consecutive orbits. However, Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI each require multiple orbits over 16 days to provide the same coverage. How do these characteristics affect the daily availability of active fire data? The relatively large swath widths of VIIRS and MODIS sensors provide comprehensive satellite observations and derived active fire detection data for the entire globe on a daily basis. Additionally, both sensors provide multiple observations daily within a relatively short period of time where consecutive swaths may overlap, more so at higher latitudes (Fig 2). Figure 2 - Example of MODIS and VIIRS orbit tracks showing overlap between tracks, especially at higher latitudes. Conversely, each Landsat OLI sensor requires 16 days to completely image the surface of the Earth. So, OLI cannot fully image large geographic areas in one day, such as the continental United States, and can only provide partial coverage. However, since the orbits of the two Landsat satellites are 8 days out of phase, the combined temporal resolution of the two OLI sensors enables complete coverage once every 8 days (Fig 3). Figure 3 – The top graphic provides an example of the swath coverage for the continental US by OLI onboard Landsat 8 (orange) and Landsat 9 (red) on July 13, 2022. Orbits for each satellite move to the east and west daily and complete a full cycle of coverage every 16 days. The bottom graphic displays the HLS imagery product in FIRMS for July 13, 2022, which contains the acquired Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 imagery over land. Areas along each swath that exceed the predetermined cloud cover threshold are excluded from HLS product in FIRMS. The combined daily coverage of OLI on both Landsat satellites can image the entire continental US, and the globe, every 8 days. When viewing daily active fire detection data in FIRMS, users should be aware of the high temporal resolution characteristics of VIIRS and MODIS versus Landsat. In Figure 4, active fires detected by Terra MODIS and Landsat on September 10, 2022, for the Pacific Northwest are provided. Landsat active fire detection data, displayed as yellow points, is only available within the 185-kilometer OLI swath. However, MODIS active fire detection data, displayed as red points, is available for the entire region within and outside of the OLI swath. Consequently, updates to the finer resolution Landsat active fire detection data for the entire Earth cannot be provided daily. Figure 4 - Active fires detected in the Pacific Northwest on September 10, 2022. 1 kilometer MODIS active fire detections (red) are available for the entire region while 30-meter Landsat 9 active fire detections (yellow) are limited to the 185-kilometer swath (WRS-2 Path 42) acquired on this date. New Near Real-Time Product in FIRMS – Landsat Active Fire Data Brad Quayle posted on Sep 29, 2022 Earlier this year, we highlighted the availability of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery in the FIRMS map viewers . This imagery, provided by NASA's IMPACT project , enables a relatively high spatial resolution perspective of fire activity and post-fire effects. Similar to MODIS and VIIRS, we are now providing active fire data in FIRMS, generated from Landsat observations. This new near real-time (NRT) Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomaly (LFTA) active fire product is the result of an ongoing collaboration by NASA LANCE/FIRMS, University of Maryland, USDA Forest Service and USGS EROS Data Center. The total elapsed time from satellite overpass to the availability of Landsat active fire detection data in FIRMS is 30 minutes or less. Users should note that these Landsat active fire detection data are provided much sooner than the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel (HLS) imagery products, that are dynamically generated, and currently available in FIRMS approximately 2 days after acquisition. Daily Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI data for CONUS and most of Canada and Mexico are collected via direct readout by USGS EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the request of NASA and the USDA Forest Service, USGS developed a near real-time data processing framework that provides Level 1 terrain corrected Landsat OLI imagery. This data is subsequently processed using NASA science data processing algorithms to generate Level 2 30 meter resolution active fire data. How does Landsat active fire data compare with MODIS and VIIRS active fire data? Landsat active fire data is more than 1,000 times more resolute than MODIS and more than 160 times more resolute than MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. The algorithm routinely detects fires as small as a few square meters, or smaller, providing spatially explicit detail of location and extent of fire activity at the time of satellite overpass. Active fire fronts, as well as scattered smaller fires within the fire perimeter are routinely detected. However, these relatively high spatial resolution data have a lower temporal resolution compared to the daily observation frequency afforded by MODIS and VIIRS. Between both Landsat OLI instruments, areas in the lower to mid latitudes are imaged every 8 days ( please see the related NASA FIRMS blog entry that describes the characteristics of different satellite sensors and their effects on the spatial extent of daily active fire data ). The temporal resolution of Landsat data can be increased though collection of nighttime Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 imagery for targeted areas when it can feasibly be done within the confines of current Landsat science and mission priorities. Viewing the LFTA in FIRMS The Landsat active fire data can be viewed in both FIRMS global and FIRMS US/Canada . The LFTA are displayed in Basic and Advanced Mode. To display the Landsat active fire detections by time since detection, select the \"Time Based\" option. To distinguish the Landsat active fire detections from other active fire detections (such as MODIS and VIIRS), select the \"Advanced Mode\" and \"Custom\" and select the \"+\" icon next to the fire detections you want to change. Select the drop down arrow to the right of the color and a color wheel will appear. Select a color and press apply. For more information see the FIRMS blog entry on How to customize the fires displayed in FIRMS A September 10, 2022 HLS Landsat 9 OLI false color composite image for the southern portion of the Double Creek Fire in northeast Oregon. In the top image, burned areas appear in dark red hues while both isolated and broadly burning areas appear bright orange-red. The bottom image highlights the 30-meter active fire detections (yellow) that correspond to actively burning areas. Users should note that Landsat active fire detection data is available in FIRMS in near real-time approximately 30 minutes after acquisition while corresponding Landsat imagery is generated dynamically and available in FIRMS 2-3 days after acquisition. New Enhancements Make Generating Imagery Subsets in Worldview Snapshots Even Easier Brad Quayle posted on Sep 11, 2022 The NASA Worldview Snapshots tool enables users to easily create satellite imagery subsets for anywhere in the world. The tool provides access to current and historical imagery captured by Terra and Aqua MODIS and S-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS. By simply selecting the desired image product, acquisition date, spatial resolution, output file type as well as entering the latitude/longitude bounding box, users can quickly generate an imagery subset to use for visualization in a GIS or as a graphic in a presentation or document. For the convenience of users who need to create satellite imagery subsets of geopolitical units, Snapshots has recently been enhanced to include predefined latitude/longitude bounding boxes for countries. After setting the basic parameters for an imagery subset, users can simply select their desired country of interest from the Countries dropdown list in Country/Region Presets box below the map. The red box that subsequently appears on the map indicates the bounding box of the subset to be generated. Users can also increase the default size of the subset boundary extent by 5% to 20% by selecting the desired 5% interval under the Padding dropdown list or manually edit the predefined coordinates as desired in the Bounding Box section of the interface. Users can also generate imagery subsets for a US state or Canadian province or territory. After selecting either of these two countries, a user can select the State / Province / Region dropdown list to update the subset bounding box extent to the targeted state, province or territory. A September 9, 2022 Aqua MODIS true color composite image for Oregon generated from NASA Worldview Snapshots. The subset bounding box is defined by the map extent of the state, predefined in Snapshots, and extended by an additional 5% in both dimensions. A screenshot of the Worldview Snapshots definition for an imagery subset of the state or Oregon. The updated interface enables users to select a country (as well as a US state and Canadian province/territory) and use its associated map extent as the bounding box coordinates for the subset boundary. If desired, users can increase the size of the predefined bounding box in 5% intervals or edit manually edit the coordinates. Landsat 9 Now Included in Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 Imagery Brad Quayle posted on Aug 23, 2022 Earlier this year, F IRMS integrated the Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 (HLS) Imagery product. This data stream has recently been enhanced with the integration of Landsat 9 data. Users can now integrate HLS True Color and False Color Composite Imagery from Landsat 9 in addition to Landsat 8. Both Landsat instruments image every location on the Earth's surface at least every 16 days and their respective orbits are 8 days out of phase. As a result, they provide 8 day repeat coverage of any area on the globe. With the two Landsat instruments and two Sentinel-2 instruments, the HLS data stream allows for 30 meter land surface observations every 2-3 days. HLS data services are made available by the NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT) and can be visualized in FIRMS map viewers approximately 2-4 days after acquisition. Please see the April 2022 FIRMS blog post for additional information on the HLS data product and how to access it in FIRMS. HLS false color composite image for the Moose Fire in northeast Idaho acquired by Landsat 8 on July 18, 2022 (top). The HLS false color image acquired on July 26, 2022 by Landsat 9 (bottom) illustrates the growth of the fire over that 8 day period. Note active fire areas in these images appear as glowing orange. How to customize the fires displayed in FIRMS Diane Davies posted on Jul 24, 2022 This blog shows you how to: change the colors of the fires/thermal anomalies change the fire pixel size show only day or night detections color code fires by Fire Radiative Power (FRP), Confidence or Time Since Detection CHANGE FIRE COLOR BY INSTRUMENT The default color for the MODIS and VIIRS thermal anomalies is red. There are times when it is useful to be able to distinguish between instruments (MODIS/VIIRS) or day/night detections. To do this Select ADVANCED MODE in the Layer List on the right of the map (see image below) Select the \"+\" icon next to the fire detections you want to change. Select the drop down arrow to the right of the color and a color wheel will appear. Select a color and press apply. This step can be repeated for other fire detection categories. CHANGE FIRE PIXEL SIZE The fire pixel size defaults to the optimal display for the zoom level. When zoomed into the highest zoom levels , MODIS pixels maintain a size of approximately 1km and VIIRS approximately 375m To change the pixel size, make sure ADVANCED MODE is selected (as shown above). Click the \"+\" icon and then click the drop down arrow next to the word \"Auto\" Adjust the pixel size from the drop down list SHOW ONLY DAY / NIGHT FIRES By default, the map shows both Day time and night time fires, to view only day time fires, may sure ADVANCED MODE is selected (as shown above). Click the \"+\" icon then click on \"Night\" to deselect it and it is greyed out. To view only nighttime fires, click on \"Night\" to turn both back on and then click on \"Day\" so it is greyed out. VIEW FIRES BY FRP, CONFIDENCE or TIME SINCE DETECTION To view fires using Fire Radiative Power (FRP), Confidence or Time Since Detection, select \"ADVANCED MODE\" in the Layer List, then select the drop down arrow next to the word \"Fires\" for the fire detections you want to change. Time Since Detection shows the fires < 1, 1-3, 3-6, 6-12, 12-24, and >24 Hours since the fires were detected by the satellite. Enable this by selecting \"Time Based\" in either Basic or Advanced Mode. 2 Comments Wildfire detection in the US and Canada within a minute of satellite observation Diane Davies posted on Jul 14, 2022 FIRMS recently integrated ultra real-time (URT) MODIS and VIIRS active fire data, within a minute of satellite observation, from multiple direct readout ground stations in the continental US (CONUS). See \" FIRMS Adds Ultra Real-Time Data from MODIS and VIIRS \" article on Earthdata.nasa.gov This is the first routine service provided by FIRMS for detecting wildfires over the continental United States from NASA and NOAA low-Earth orbit satellites with a latency of less than 60 seconds from Earth observation to wildfire detection. The ultra real-time processing has been made possible by the Space Science and Engineering Center ( SSEC ) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison with funding from NASA's WildFireSense program. Software systems enable the SSEC to stream direct broadcast data in real-time from each antenna to a central collection point at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, which then ingests and merges the data, including de-duplication of overlapping data, in real-time. Currently URT data are received from Madison, Wisconsin (2 antennas), Hampton, Virginia and Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. In addition to the URT, Real-Time (RT) data are received from Honolulu, Hawaii and Monterey, California (after the pass is complete). Latency for RT data is 20—30 minutes. It is anticipated that the real-time data will be expanded to include additional CONUS stations and stations in Alaska and Hawaii. Figure showing current and planned coverage of Direct Broadcast stations collecting ultra real-time and real-time data URT and RT thermal anomaly / fire detections are processed using the LANCE FIRMS active fire algorithms, so the data are comparable with the NRT data from LANCE. URT and RT data are available in both FIRMS and FIRMS US/Canada Fire maps and can be identified by the URT or RT suffix in the \"version\" - found by clicking on the fires to view the attributes. URT and RT data are also available in the WMS and WFS map services and KMZs. URT and RT data will roll off the system within six hours as the NRT data becomes available. Screenshot showing URT fire detected on 2022/06/30. The f ire was observed at 12:17 CDT and displayed in FIRMS at 12:19 CDT (as shown by computer time on top right of screen) Users can see the real-time fire detections by selecting the Time Based option which color codes fires by Time Since Detection. However it is important to note that the URT and RT fires only show up within a minute of satellite fly-over so users need to know when the satellite passes overhead. To find our what time the satellite overpass is you can load the orbit tracks. (see next screenshot) Screenshot showing descending overpass times from Suomi-NPP, NOAA-20, Aqua and Terra. These can be added by going to Advanced Mode and then selecting tracks from the Orbit Tracks and Overpass Times. Once you have the Orbit tracks loaded, make sure the fires display using the \"Time-Based\" option and the look for the deep red colored squares. New - GeoTIFF from FIRMS Screenshot Diane Davies posted on Jul 13, 2022 FIRMS fire map users have always had the opportunity to compile a map view using desired layers and then capture a screenshot and save it as a JPG, PNG or GIF file to use or share. Users now have the option of capturing a FIRMS map view as a GeoTIFF image file. The GeoTIFF format includes spatial (georeferencing) information embedded in the .tif file so it can be integrated and viewed with other geospatial data. The GeoTIFF standard is in the public domain and can be readily imported and displayed in many GIS applications. To create a GeoTIFF, click on the \"screenshot\" icon from the lower right of the FIRMS user interface and select \"GeoTIFF\" from the dropdown option in the screenshot window. New - Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 Imagery (beta version) Diane Davies posted on Apr 18, 2022 In collaboration with NASA's IMPACT project , dynamic false color imagery is now available through FIRMS to help better delineate burned areas. A screenshot from FIRMS US/Canada displaying the Sentinel-2 Adjusted Reflectance Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) using bands 12-8a-4. It shows the Hermits Peak Fire in New Mexico, USA as captured on 3 May 2022. In this image, the burned areas appear in brick red and are overlain with active fire pixels from MODIS and VIIRS. ( Link to view in FIRMS ) FIRMS has recently integrated an additional Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 (HLS) Imagery product. The Reflectance (Bands 7-5-4) layer from Landsat 8/OLI and (Bands 12, 8a, 4) from Sentinel 2A and 2B are false color composite (FCC) images that allow us to visualize wavelengths that the human eye cannot see (i.e. short wave infrared and near infrared). Burned areas appear almost brick red making it easier to see fire affected areas and water is very dark, almost black, which makes it much easier to see lakes or flooded lands. Unlike other satellite imagery layers in FIRMS, which are provided through NASA GIBS , the beta version HLS False Color Composite Imagery (Bands 7-5-4 for Landsat and Bands 12, 8a, 4 for Sentinel 2A and 2B), are provided dynamically through the NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT) , as such it may take slightly longer to display than the HLS True Color imagery through GIBS. HLS imagery is currently available approximately 2 -4 days after acquisition. Steps to view the HLS FCC layers: The HLS layers are only available in Advanced Mode (basic mode has reduced functionality to minimize the complexity of the interface). • Go to https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/usfs/map/ or https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/ • Toggle the “Advanced Mode” button in the upper right . • Toggle the “Historical” button in the upper right. • The HLS Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery are in the “Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2” grouping in the table of contents. • Use the tools/prompts to access and view the imagery. • Toggle on the True Color imagery first to get a good idea of where the FCC data can be expected on a given day. Use the screenshot tool to create a GeoTIFF of the image to enable the image to be imported in to a GIS. Some things to note: • The HLS imagery is not near real-time data. It is currently available about 2 -4 days after acquisition. • The reach back on this service goes back to March 15, 2022. • As the FCC is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than the True Color imagery through GIBS. We are monitoring the performance of the HLS FCC imagery and welcome feedback. • Zoom scale to display the false color composite data is currently set to 11 through 14, but true color can be viewed at smaller scales. The zoom level is indicated at the very end of the URL (e.g., 11z). • Orbit tracks for Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A and 2B are available as layers in the table of contents. • Landsat 9 data is anticipated to be incorporated into the HLS product in late April. At that time, or soon thereafter, it will be part of the HLS service in FIRMS. Find out more about HLS New FIRMS Feature / Location Tool Diane Davies posted on Jan 11, 2022 FIRMS recently added a location tool to enable users to easily find and save places of interest. Open the Location Tool by clicking on the \"Location\" icon from the bottom menu of FIRMS Fire Map or the FIRMS US/Canada Fire Map . Enter the location or coordinates to search in the \"Find Location\" tab, c hecking the box to \"allow multiple location selection\". Click on the \"Current Location\" to find out what location you are viewing. Any locations you store for future visits will be saved under the \"Saved Locations\" tab. Basic and Advanced Modes for FIRMS Users Brad Quayle posted on Aug 24, 2021 Basic Mode FIRMS provides a comprehensive array of near real-time NASA Earth observations and derived science data products to detect the location and extent of fire activity and its effects on the land and atmosphere. FIRMS has recently implemented a scalable user interface to better meet the needs and use cases of various users. When initiating the fire map for either FIRMS Global or FIRMS US/Canada FIRMS, the user interface to the right of the map window defaults to BASIC MODE . In this mode, a focused list of commonly used layers is presented to the user for display. This list includes MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data, locations of current US and Canada large wildland fires, true color MODIS and VIIRS satellite imagery and particular background and overlay layers. By simply selecting the button, users can choose to toggle to ADVANCED MODE. In this mode, all available FIRMS layers are provided for users to access and display. This includes false color MODIS and VIIRS satellite imagery, MODIS and VIIRS land and atmosphere science data products, additional sources of satellite imagery, contextual layers for wildland fire management, and several overlay and background layers. As with other user-applied customizations to the fire map, when a bookmark is created, the map will retain the applied mode when you return to the map using that referenced bookmark. FIRMS is continuing to add relevant sources of Earth observation data and science data products. Please stay tuned as we continue to introduce these additional sources of data and associated tools and utilities. Advanced Mode Where’s the smoke coming from? Brad Quayle posted on Jul 15, 2021 Viewing smoke in FIRMS using corrected reflectance imagery Wildland fires can be a significant source of smoke that not only impairs our ability to enjoy clear vistas, but the gases and particulate matter it contains can be harmful to public health. When you see smoke in the sky it may be originating from a relatively local fire or a fire that is occurring several hundred miles away. True color composite imagery acquired by Terra MODIS, Aqua MODIS, S-NPP VIIRS or NOAA-20 VIIRS are provided as “Backgrounds” layers in FIRMS and FIRMS US/Canada Fire Maps. These layers display a \"natural color image\" of the Earth’s surface as it would look to the human eye from space. Consequently, it is easy to see smoke using this type of imagery in clear sky conditions. The time of observation for these four satellites occur at different times during the day, so they can be used to identify current sources of wildland fire smoke and visualize its transport across long distances. Use the Orbit Tracks and Overpass Times layers to determine the daily overpass time for each satellite. Viewing smoke in FIRMS using aerosol indices The standard Aerosol Index (AI) derived from S-NPP OMPS observations can also be used for identifying and tracking smoke as well as other aerosols. The OMPS Al, available as an “Overlays” layer in the FIRMS and FIRMS US/Canada Fire Maps, detects and measures the density of smoke and suspended particles in the vertical air column in the atmosphere. Typical values of the AI range from 0 to 5 and indicate dust storms or biomass burning smoke located in the lower troposphere (1-3 km). Values of 5.0 indicate heavy concentrations of aerosols that could reduce visibility or impact human health. For AI values significantly higher than 5 use the OMPS PyroCumuloNimbus, or pyroCb, AI layer. Larger pyroCb AI values between 5 and 10 usually indicate dense smoke from intensely burning fires that reach higher in the troposphere. Once the index gets above 10, the smoke has likely been produced from a pyroCb event, with dense smoke lofted into the upper troposphere and, often, into the stratosphere. Wildland fire smoke visible in S-NPP VIIRS true color imagery acquired on July 11, 2021 (top). Active fire detections are displayed as red points. The aerosol index derived from S-NPP OMPS observations collected at the same time as the VIIRS imagery is provided for comparison (bottom). The high index values over Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana indicate high concentrations of aerosols and are a result from fire activity in the Pacific Northwest and northern California. High aerosol index values in the eastern Dakotas, Minnesota and western Ontario are sourced from wildland fire activity in eastern Manitoba and western Ontario. Additional information about wildland fires in US and Canada Brad Quayle posted on Jul 08, 2021 Get information and zoom to extent of wildland fires The new FIRMS US/Canada fire map includes the location and details of wildland and prescribed fires. Locations of currently/recently active incidents larger than 100 acres (40.5 hectares) are displayed as fire icons when you open the US & Canada Fire Map. Click USA Active Fires and Canada Active Fires layers to toggle them off. Click on a fire location to view the name, discovery date/time and current size of the fire. This information is routinely updated and maintained in systems of record managed by US and Canadian wildland fire management agencies. Clicking the View Situation Report link spawns a national situation report which may contain specific reporting information about the fire of interest. Additionally, by clicking the ZOOM TO LOCATION button, your map extent will automatically zoom to the extent of that fire. Clicking on a fire location provides information about the fire and the option to zoom to the map extent of the selected fire. Perimeters for current US wildland fires For wildland fires currently occurring in the US larger than 100 acres in size, fire perimeters are provided for context. These data are typically compiled by federal, state and local fire management agencies on a routine basis during the life of an incident, however, they may not be available for all incidents. These data are typically updated daily from multiple sources and indicate the current extent of the fire and containment lines. Click on USA Fire Perimeter layer to display the fire perimeter data in the FIRMS US/Canada Fire Map. When using perimeters in the context of satellite active fire detection data, this can indicate where a fire is active within the perimeter and if it is growing outside of it. Additionally, if the fire perimeter is not fully covered by cumulative active fire detections, gaps in that coverage may indicate where the fire has grown in between observations by polar-orbiting satellite sensors like MODIS and VIIRS, cloud cover at the time of satellite overpass occluded observations when the fire was actively burning, or fire activity was smaller and/or less intense at the time of satellite overpass or was not detectable under the vegetation canopy. Isolated active fire detection pixels outside of the perimeter can be indicative of detections occuring towards the edge of a swath which results geolocational errors due to the increasingly distorted field of view in the scan track direction, particularly for MODIS. Visualization of MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data in the context of a current perimeter for a wildland fire. New FIRMS Feature/Capability Highlight Brad Quayle posted on Jun 30, 2021 The FIRMS team has introduced several new features and capabilities to both FIRMS Global and FIRMS US/Canada. We’ll continue to highlight these new additions over several future posts. In this post, we would like to highlight the Time Since Detection classification for MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data that is available in the fire map for FIRMS Global and FIRMS US/Canada. This classification symbolizes active fires based on their time of detection relative to the current time. This enables users to visualize recent fire progression and currently active fire fronts for wildland fires. The temporal classification displays active fire detections occurring in the past 0 to 6 hours (deep red), detections occurring 6 to 12 hours earlier (red) and 12 to 24 hours earlier (orange), and detections occurring previous to the last 24 hour period (yellow). Setting the Time Since Detection Classification in FIRMS Open the fire map viewer for FIRMS Global or FIRMS US/Canada Select the Time Since Detection choice from the pick list associated for a particular satellite/sensor source in the FIRMS display control window to apply this classification to the active fire detection data for that source layer To apply it for all the MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection layers, click the Time Based button at the top of in the FIRMS display control window Examples of active fire data displayed with the time since detection classification: Examples for setting the time since detection classification in FIRMS SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS active fire detection locations in Northern California symbolized by their time since detection at ~17:00 PDT June 30, 2021 SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS active fire detection locations in Western Ontario symbolized by their time since detection at ~19:00 CDT June 30, 2021 New Web Services added to FIRMS US/Canada and FIRMS Global Diane Davies posted on Jun 08, 2021 FIRMS has added additional capability to integrate satellite active fire detection data as streaming web services. Several new geospatial web services are now available to meet the needs of end users in visualizing and analyzing these data in the context of geospatial information in desktop or web mapping applications. New Web Map Services In addition to legacy FIRMS Web Map Services (WMS) that provide MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data for the past 24, 48, 72 hours or the past 7 days, new services are provided that display these data relative to their time since detection. New WMS options enable visualization of cumulative MODIS and VIIRS active fire data for the current calendar year in two temporal classifications that depict the data in its relative time since detection. Please see the WMS information page for FIRMS US/Canada and FIRMS Global for service connection information and tutorials on how to access the services. Temporal classifications for the new MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection web map services available in FIRMS. New Web Feature Services FIRMS has also introduced new regional Web Feature Services (WFS) that stream the centroids of active fire detection pixels for MODIS and VIIRS as geographic point features. The services allow end users to manipulate and analyze features in the services using a geospatial client. These services are configured to enable access to MODIS or VIIRS active fire data for the past 24 hours or the past 7 days. Please see the WFS information page for FIRMS US/Canada and FIRMS Global for service connection information and tutorials on how to access the services. FIRMS US/Canada Prototype Released Diane Davies posted on Jan 09, 2021 FIRMS US/Canada is a new version of Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) focused on the US and Canada, developed in partnership between NASA and the US Forest Service.

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m thermal anomalies / active fire product provides data from the VIIRS sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. The 375 m data complements Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375 m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity.

The data cover the period March 26-31, 2013, which corresponds to Julian Days 85-90. The white outline represents the burned area mapped using 30m Landsat-7 on March 31. Note the more coherent fire spread and the excellent spatial agreement of the VIIRS 375m data (right image).

Fire products from VIIRS: A complementary VIIRS M-Band 750 m active fire data product is available in HDF format from NASA's Earthdata Search and from the University of Maryland VIIRS Active Fire Web page . FIRMS has opted to distribute the 375 m product rather than the 750 m product as the increased spatial resolution and increased number of fires detected is of interest to the to the broader fire management community.

It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence values are set to low, nominal and high. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those free of potential sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels. Please note: Low confidence nighttime pixels occur only over the geographic area extending from 11deg E to 110 deg W and 7 deg N to 55 deg S. This area describes the region of influence of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly which can cause spurious brightness temperatures in the mid-infrared channel I4 leading to potential false positive alarms. These have been removed from the NRT data distributed by FIRMS.

FRP Fire Radiative Power FRP depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (megawatts). FRP depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (megawatts). Given the unique spatial and spectral resolution of the data, the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm was customized and tuned in order to optimize its response over small fires while balancing the occurrence of false alarms. Frequent saturation of the mid-infrared I4 channel (3.55-3.93 µm) driving the detection of active fires requires additional tests and procedures to avoid pixel classification errors. As a result, sub-pixel fire characterization (e.g., fire radiative power [FRP] retrieval) is only viable across small and/or low-intensity fires. Systematic FRP retrievals are based on a hybrid approach combining 375 and 750 m data. In fact, starting in 2015 the algorithm incorporated additional VIIRS channel M13 (3.973-4.128 µm) 750 m data in both aggregated and unaggregated format. DayNight Day or Night D= Daytime fire, N= Nighttime fire Image The VIIRS pixel footprint size projected onto the Earth increases away from nadir. The VIIRS I-Band 375 m Active Fire Product Algorithm The VIIRS 375 m active fire product is described in Schroeder et al (2014) . The product builds on the MODIS fire product heritage [ Kaufman et al., 1998; Giglio et al., 2003 et al. ], using a multi-spectral contextual algorithm to identify sub-pixel fire activity and other thermal anomalies in the Level 1 (swath) input data. The algorithm uses all five 375 m VIIRS channels to detect fires and separate land, water, and cloud pixels in the image. Additional 750 m channels complement the available VIIRS multispectral data. Those channels are used as input to the baseline active fire detection product, which provides continuity to the EOS/MODIS 1km Fire and Thermal Anomalies product. Some Key information about VIIRS The VIIRS sensor aboard the Suomi NPP satellite, crosses the equator at approximately 13:30 PM (ascending node) and 1:30 AM (descending node). The VIIRS sensor aboard the NOAA-20 satellite, crosses the equator approximately 50 minutes prior to Suomi NPP, at approximately 12:40 PM (ascending node) and 12:40 AM (descending node). The 3,040 km VIIRS swath enables ~15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator, thereby providing full global coverage every 12 hours and mid-latitudes will experience 3-4 looks a day. VIIRS has 5 high resolution Imagery channels (I-bands), 16 moderate resolution channels (M-bands) and a Day/Night Band (DNB). The VIIRS detectors have a constant angular resolution that results in an increasing pixel footprint size as the scan is further from nadir (see figure 1 below). This means the actual area of each scan has the shape of a bow-tie, as consecutive scans overlap away from nadir. The bow-tie effect is reduced during processing through a combination of aggregation and deletion of overlapping pixels.

The Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) was developed to provide near real-time active fire locations to natural resource managers that faced challenges obtaining timely satellite-derived fire information. In partnership with the U.S. Forest Service, a FIRMS US/Canada map service was launched in January 2021. FIRMS was developed in 2007 by the University of Maryland, with funds from NASA’s Applied Sciences Program and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO), to provide near real-time active fire locations to natural resource managers that faced challenges obtaining timely satellite-derived fire information. A version of FIRMS, known as the Global Fire Information Management System (GFIMS) ran at the UN FAO from 2010–2012, where it complemented the FAO’s existing suite of projects that deliver near real-time information to ongoing monitoring and emergency projects, to other UN organizations as well as providing information to the general public. GFIMS is no longer actively supported. Links Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Acknowledgements, Citation and Disclaimer About FIRMS US/Canada FIRMS US/Canada provides the USDA Forest Service, partner agencies, and the general public access to tools and data to visualize and monitor the location, extent, intensity, and impacts of wildfire activity in the U.S. and Canada. The source of low latency satellite imagery, science data products, and enabling technologies to FIRMS US/Canada include: the NASA Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ) and other partners. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) are the foundational satellite data sources of the current FIRMS US/Canada application. Additional geospatial data and information from various agencies are also integrated to provide context for current/recent wildfire activity. Sources for these additional data include the National Interagency Fire Center, Department of the Interior Office of Wildland Fire, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, Canadian Interagency Fire Centre, and Natural Resources Canada FIRMS US/Canada builds on a longstanding partnership between NASA and the Forest Service. In 2001, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, (GSFC) and the University of Maryland (UMD) developed the MODIS Land Rapid Response System to provide time-critical, science grade data products to the Forest Service and other users. That same year, the Forest Service implemented the Active Fire Mapping (AFM) Program to ingest near real-time data from the, now decommissioned, MODIS Land Rapid Response System to produce and disseminate value-added geospatial fire products. AFM since evolved to leverage and ingest MODIS and VIIRS satellite direct readout data and the NASA LANCE MODIS/VIIRS data stream. FIRMS US/Canada is a joint NASA/Forest Service effort to modernize and optimize the legacy AFM Program data and product delivery capabilities that have provided imagery and geospatial fire products for the United States and Canada since 2001. The initial release of FIRMS US/Canada was launched in January 2021 and provides an updated platform for delivery of near real-time satellite data products as well as mapping and visualization capabilities. Data from additional near real-time satellite sources and other technical capabilities are also planned for the FIRMS US/Canada application after the initial early-2021 release.

LANCE processes data as soon as they are downlinked from satellites or transmitted from ground stations, generally within 30 minutes to two hours after satellite observation. Routines used to derive Level 2 products, such as fire, snow, and sea ice products, do not make use of ancillary data and therefore their codes are identical to the ones used in standard operations. The difference between MODIS geolocation when using definitive vs. predicted attitude and ephemeris is routinely less than 100 meters. However, there are situations, particularly before and after spacecraft maneuvers and during space weather events, when the difference can increase up to several kilometers. The recommendation from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System ( EOSDIS ) is to utilize the standard product data, which are reprocessed using the definitive attitude and ephemeris data. Known Issues MCD14DL are NRT products and may be subject to geo-location errors or reprocessing.

Compared to other coarser resolution (≥1km) satellite fire detection products, the improved 375 m data provide greater response over fires of relatively small areas, as well as improved mapping of large fire perimeters. Consequently, the data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. The 375 m product complements the baseline Suomi NPP/VIIRS 750 m active fire detection and characterization data, which was originally designed to provide continuity to the existing 1 km Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (EOS/MODIS) active fire data record.

It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence values are set to low, nominal and high. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those free of potential sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels. Please note: Low confidence nighttime pixels occur only over the geographic area extending from 11° E to 110° W and 7° N to 55° S. This area describes the region of influence of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly which can cause spurious brightness temperatures in the mid-infrared channel I4 leading to potential false positive alarms. These have been removed from the NRT data distributed by FIRMS.

FRP Fire Radiative Power FRP depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (megawatts). Given the unique spatial and spectral resolution of the data, the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm was customized and tuned in order to optimize its response over small fires while balancing the occurrence of false alarms. Frequent saturation of the mid-infrared I4 channel (3.55-3.93 µm) driving the detection of active fires requires additional tests and procedures to avoid pixel classification errors. As a result, sub-pixel fire characterization (e.g., fire radiative power [FRP] retrieval) is only viable across small and/or low-intensity fires. Systematic FRP retrievals are based on a hybrid approach combining 375 and 750 m data. In fact, starting in 2015 the algorithm incorporated additional VIIRS channel M13 (3.973-4.128 µm) 750 m data in both aggregated and unaggregated format.

Moses, System Engineer, NASA Earth Observing System (SSAI, Inc.) Oct 31, 2022 Image Miles above Earth's surface, a thin layer of ozone gas acts as a shield that protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Credit: NASA. Ozone (O 3 ), a gas made up of three oxygen atoms, is something of a double-edged compound. In the upper stratosphere, where it occurs naturally, ozone protects life on Earth from the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. This is the so-called “good” ozone. Yet, in the troposphere, the lowest level atmosphere near Earth's surface, ozone can be created by reactions between airborne pollutants, and at ground level, high ozone concentrations can be toxic to humans. This is the “bad” ozone. The natural concentration of ozone in the troposphere is about 10 parts per billion (10 molecules for every billion air molecules), much lower than the 2-8 parts per million in the ozone layer where most (85-90%) of the planet's ozone is located. However, the levels of tropospheric ozone can rise when nitrogen oxide gases from vehicle and industrial emissions react with volatile organic compounds (e.g., carbon-containing chemicals such as paint thinners) that evaporate easily into the air. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to ozone levels of greater than 70 parts per billion for 8 hours or longer is unhealthy . Such concentrations occur in or near cities during periods where the atmosphere is warm and stable, and the harmful effects of prolonged exposure can result in throat and lung irritation, aggravation of asthma, or emphysema. Fortunately, the presence of ozone and other trace (small percentage) gasses in the atmosphere, including pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), can be detected by their unique spectral signatures. This is precisely what the Ozone Monitoring Instrument ( OMI ) aboard NASA's Aura satellite was created to do. NASA launched the Aura satellite, the third of its flagship Earth Observing System satellite missions behind Terra and Aqua, in 2004. Flying about 15 minutes behind Aqua as part of the Afternoon Constellation (or A-train ) of Earth-observing satellites, Aura's four instruments—the Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS ), the High-Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder ( HIRDLS ), the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer ( TES ), and OMI—were designed to collect data about the chemistry and dynamics of Earth's atmosphere, enabling scientists to investigate the presence and trends in atmospheric trace gas concentrations, the trends and processes that create various atmospheric conditions, and the impact of climate change on air quality. One of the most important aims of the Aura mission was to assess and monitor the stratospheric ozone layer. Concern about ozone depletion in the 1970s led to a congressional mandate that charged NASA and NOAA with developing ways to monitor and track the amounts of ozone and ozone-depleting gases in the atmosphere. Following the discovery of the ozone hole over the South Pole by NASA and British researchers in the early 1980s and the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , which sought to end the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) beginning in 1987, NASA has routinely monitored the state of stratospheric ozone levels around the globe to assess the ozone hole's recovery. Monitoring serves to gauge the effect of regulations designed to curb the use of ozone-depleting chemicals. OMI Origins Image The OMI instrument’s UV and visible infrared channels provide high resolution measurements of backscatter radiation from which scientists can retrieve concentrations of ozone and other trace gases. Credit: NASA Scientific Visualization Studio. To help it perform these critical roles, NASA partnered with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute ( KNMI ) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute ( FMI ) to develop and operate the OMI instrument. Built by Dutch Space (now Airbus Defense and Space Netherlands ) and aerospace company TNO , OMI is a nadir-viewing wide-field-imaging spectrometer designed to provide high-resolution observations of O 3 , NO 2 (total as well as tropospheric columns), and SO 2 , as well as other trace gases and aerosols like dust and smoke by measuring mid-range ultraviolet (UV) and visible infrared radiation from multiple fields of view simultaneously. As such, it is an improvement over legacy sensors such as the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS ) aboard NASA’s Earth Probe Satellite and the European Space Agency's ( ESA ) Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment ( GOME ) instrument aboard the ESA ERS-2 satellite “OMI was the first to obtain daily global coverage with very high spatial resolution, measuring ultraviolet and visible spectra at the same time,” said OMI Principal Investigator Dr. Pieternel Levelt. “So, there was an expectation that we could improve on the space-based ozone and air quality measurements with OMI. Its potential to measure air pollution and emission sources in the troposphere turned out to be unprecedented” Those expectations were spot on. “One of the very interesting things that came out of our research work with OMI was the ability to determine tropospheric ozone with techniques like cloud slicing,” said U.S. OMI science team leader Dr. Joanna Joiner. “By measuring the total column ozone above thick clouds we can determine the stratospheric ozone amount accurately in the tropics. Defining stratosphere ozone, which of course lies between the instrument and troposphere, is important for being able to determine trends in tropospheric ozone.” OMI is not the only instrument aboard Aura that measures ozone and trace gases. MLS provides high vertical resolution profiles of the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) that are nearly simultaneous with those from OMI. By combining these observations with meteorological data, scientists have developed algorithms that separate out the ozone observed in the stratosphere from ozone in the atmospheric column to derive measurements of tropospheric ozone. OMI and MLS observations have also been combined with atmospheric profiles of O 3 from the TES instrument, giving atmospheric scientists a better understanding of the stratospheric and tropospheric contributions to ozone as well as the physical and chemical processes that effect their distributions in these layers of the atmosphere. Image Left image: OMI and MLS can estimate the tropospheric ozone residual by subtracting the MLS stratospheric ozone from the OMI column ozone. High residual regions correspond to pollution sources and transport. Right image: The monthly mean maps show pollution streaming from biomass burning in the equatorial zone in the Southern Hemisphere (upper image); streaming from the United States, Europe, and China in the Northern Hemisphere summer (lower image); and the transport of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere. Credit: NASA. Beyond ozone, OMI has improved the detection of atmospheric SO 2 from erupting and outgassing volcanoes, oil and gas production sites, power plants, and other industrial operations. “Detecting individual sources of SO 2 —sources that were previously undetected and not in the emissions databases used by modelers—quantifying them, and tracing them over time has been an exciting challenge,” said Joiner. “Trends in SO 2 and NO 2 have been surprising, both upwards and downwards and in different parts of the world. So, being able to measure and track them accurately has been important.” OMI has also enhanced the detection of aerosols and provided insight into their effects on climatological phenomena. “When you have more smoke over clouds the sunlight gets absorbed by the smoke and the dust, and the clouds reflect less light,” said Joiner. “For example, we've seen recent fires, very intense fires, that create a large amount of absorbing material that gets very high in the atmosphere, and it can remain for long periods of time and impact the radiation balance. It's important to have a long-term record so that when such events happen in the future we can get an idea of how frequent they are.” Image This map shows the location of sulfur dioxide emissions as detected by emissions databases and satellite observations . Red rectangles highlight daily volcanic regions, green areas show regions with short-term daily pollution, and blue areas identify locations with long-term pollution. Previously undetected individual sources were identified using OMI data. Credit: NASA Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Laboratory. These improvements are a direct result of OMI's high-resolution measurements. \"With small pixels one can measure in-between clouds more often, which is important for penetrating to the lower kilometers in the troposphere for measuring air pollution,\" said Levelt. \"With an instrument like OMI that measures across the ultraviolet and visible spectrum, one cannot measure through the clouds, just as we cannot see through a cloud with our own eyes. Therefore, it is important to have small pixels so that the instrument measures the pollution residing in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Moreover, the smaller the pixels, the better one can measure and localize small emission sources.\" OMI also advanced the use of satellites for air quality observations by offering measurements for never-before-seen areas. \"People thought you couldn't see pollution in sparsely populated areas at high latitudes like Finland. It was thought to be clean and nothing there,\" said FMI's Dr. Johanna Tamminen, an OMI Co-Principal Investigator. \"But when we started to average data, zoom, and adjust display scales, OMI started to show us interesting things. It was a real eye-opener that we could also use satellites to look at the air quality in Finland.\" Of course, OMI's most significant contribution to the atmospheric research community , as noted in this 2018 paper by Levelt, et al., is its long-term, 18-year data record. \"Being able to observe atmospheric conditions at the city scale is allowing us to understand their impacts on human health and even health inequities depending on where people live. To do this you need a long-term data record,\" Joiner said. \"Air quality can change significantly based on the local weather. OMI's coverage allows you to compare a day from a week in February with the same week averaged over several previous years to draw reasonable conclusions by minimizing the impact local weather has on air pollution. You need an assessment of what normal NO 2 emissions look like to be able to see the impact.\" Identifying those long-term trends is essential for determining whether regulations, like those enacted to curb the use of CFCs or reduce emissions of NO 2 , are having an effect. OMI’s 18-year data record shows that they are. Image OMI's stability and low degradation makes it possible to see complex decadal trends in nitrogen dioxide, a common pollutant from cars and power plants, and sulfur dioxide from coal-fired power plants over environments where air quality data were previously not available. Left images: The OMI maps of sulfur dioxide (top image) and nitrogen dioxide (middle image) for 2005-2007 show pollution around major cities and industrial centers, along with a city nighttime lights map (bottom image). Middle image: This time series plot details the percent change in annual average nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide relative to 2005 for the Ohio Valley region outlined in the maps to the right of the plot. Right images: The map colors depict average vertical column density for nitrogen dioxide (upper image) and sulfur dioxide (lower image) for the years 2005 to 2015. Credit: NASA. “NASA's Aura satellite detects gasses like NO 2 , a common pollutant from cars and power plants. The data show us that the U.S. and Europe have some of the highest emissions in the world,” said former U.S. President Barack Obama in a 2016 video from DNews. “But it also shows us that, in the last 25 years, NO 2 levels have dropped by up to 50% in both regions, thanks in large part to new rules that protect our air. Imagery like this can help us see what actions are working, and where we need to focus additional international efforts.” Having a consistent long-term data record allows researchers to establish local and seasonal baseline trends, so they can assess both normal conditions and the effects of out-of-the-ordinary events, when conditions may be changing rapidly. For example, by comparing data from the previous five years to measurements taken during COVID lockdowns, scientists were able to assess the lockdown's impact on transportation using OMI NO 2 observations. Beyond clarifying long-term atmospheric trends, scientists have used OMI's lengthy data record to devise new applications for the instrument's data, such as retrieving new trace gas species, helping evaluate physical models of the Sun, and experimenting with new inverse modelling techniques to estimate pollution emissions, such as along the coast of China. Image Nitrogen dioxide emissions and the impact of COVID lockdowns . Left image: The image on left shows nighttime lights—an indicator of human activity—for most of the San Francisco metropolitan area during a shelter-in-place mandate on March 17, 2020. While the mandate was in effect, non-essential businesses were closed and approximately 6.7 million residents were asked to stay home. Right image: Comparisons of OMI nitrogen dioxide observations during normal activity for that time of year revealed a clearing of the air during lockdown, with an estimated 22% reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels. Credit: NASA COVID 19 Dashboard. As a case in point, a recent paper published in Frontiers of Remote Sensing discussed the use of OMI data to help fill gaps in the record of ocean color measurements , or the spectral composition of the visible light field that emanates from the ocean, which provides clues to the substances (e.g., phytoplankton and suspended sediments) that are dissolved and suspended in the water column. “Even after 18 years in space we're still learning new things that we can do with OMI and similar instruments,” said Joiner. “When we learn how to do something new, we can always go back and reprocess existing data to create a long record of new and improved products.” OMI's long-term data record is a consequence of the instrument's remarkable durability and stability. During its nearly two decades in space, OMI has experienced only minor optical problems, unusually low optical degradation over its lifespan, and detector degradation well within the expected range. This is significant as observational errors typically increase with sensor degradation. “Over its 18-year life, the detector degradation has reached the point where retrievals for trace gases like formaldehyde, which typically has very low spectral signatures, are difficult,” said Levelt. “As far as the other OMI products, the detector degradation may impact NO 2 and SO 2 products, but not to the level that it significantly challenges the retrievals. It's just amazing.” Image This graphic shows (a) the average of OMI tropospheric nitrogen dioxide column concentrations over the ocean along the coast of China from 2007 to 2016, (b) nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions over the ocean along the coast of China derived by daily emission estimates constrained from satellite measurements applied to OMI observations, and (c) three selected regions where shipping emissions were examined near the Chinese coast. (The circled numbers indicate the name of the regions, while the non-circled numbers indicate the locations of the country's main harbors. For more information, see Ding, et al., 2018 .) Of course, no instrument or satellite orbits Earth forever. Therefore, it likely came as little surprise when, after 18 years, NASA's Aura Project began reporting decommissioning scenarios, plans, and schedules at Mission Operations Working Group meetings. Various de-orbiting scenarios are under consideration, but eventually Aura's instruments will need to be turned off as part of spacecraft passivation, which is projected to occur in 2025 (if maximally extended). In the interim, Aura will drift from its traditional orbit, but the change is expected to be small and the impact on data quality is forecast to be minimal. Next Generation Instruments After Aura has been decommissioned, three newer instruments already in orbit—the Joint Polar Satellite System’s (JPSS) Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite ( OMPS ), the ESA GOME-2 instrument, and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument ( TROPOMI )—will become the primary sources for daily global hyperspectral observations of ozone and trace gases, including SO 2 and NO 2 . The OMPS instruments aboard the joint NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) and NOAA-20 satellites are now the operational instruments for NOAA's ozone monitoring program. OMPS was designed to measure atmospheric total column ozone with configurable nadir temporal (along-track) and spatial (across-track) resolutions. OMPS on Suomi NPP collects data at a larger 50x50 km pixel size, while NOAA-20 OMPS observations are collected at a smaller pixel size. OMPS also offers SO 2 and other trace gas measurements but lacks spectral coverage in the violet-blue wavelength typically used for NO 2 retrievals. (Note: NO 2 observations are possible from OMPS, but they are less optimal as compared with OMI.) Image OMPS tracks the health of the ozone layer and measures the concentration of ozone and other aerosols in Earth's atmosphere. The instrument flies aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites and is scheduled to fly on the forthcoming JPSS-2, -3, and -4 satellite missions. ESA's GOME-2 instrument, which flies aboard its MetOp series satellites, and TROPOMI will become the primary sources for daily global hyperspectral observations of ozone and trace gases, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Credits: JPSS and ESA. In addition to OMPS, TROPOMI (the next generation instrument after OMI) was launched in 2017 aboard the European Sentinel-5P satellite, which circles Earth in an afternoon orbit slightly higher than Aura. Compared to OMI, TROPOMI has a higher spatial resolution (3.5 x 5.5 km 2 ) and a higher signal-to-noise ratio-per-ground pixel. It provides measurements of the same trace gases that can be monitored with OMI plus methane and carbon monoxide. TROPOMI's spectral requirements, calibration, and stability are about the same as OMI. These improvements are noteworthy, said Levelt, who is the scientific initiator of the TROPOMI instrument. “Regardless of TROPOMI's smaller pixel size, we get at least the same and up to five times more radiation depending on the wavelength,” she said. “Another big improvement is the addition of the oxygen bands to improve information about clouds. With the extra bands, we can get more parameters enabling us to determine cloud fraction, cloud height, surface albedo, and cloud albedo. The short-wave infrared channel (SWIR) that was added for carbon monoxide and methane monitoring is performing extremely well. The methane measurements are especially newsworthy, showing many methane sources, such as those from oil and gas exploration and landfills.” The TROPOMI mission has a seven-year lifespan, although it could remain in orbit much longer. ESA is planning three follow-on instruments, called Sentinel-5 /UVNS, that will be similar to TROPOMI with 7-km pixel size and an extra shortwave infrared channel. Sentinel-5/UVNS is the follow-up of the GOME-2 instrument and will fly in a morning, rather than afternoon, orbit. “We find ourselves in the position of going to a morning orbit with a similar spatial resolution and more spectral coverage, but we lose the afternoon orbit,” said Levelt, who is a member of ESA's Sentinel-4 and -5 Mission Advisory Group, which is planning three Sentinel-5 (TROPOMI-like) instruments over the next 20 years. She and her colleagues are aware that a potential gap in afternoon coverage could impact long-term data continuity after TROPOMI, especially for NO 2 and methane observations. Air quality scientists and modelers have expressed similar concern about the impact of losing early afternoon observations of trace gas satellite retrievals. In the morning, the boundary layer is not well mixed and resides mainly in the first few hundred meters above the surface. During the day the Sun warms the atmosphere and the boundary layer gets well-mixed, which makes interpretation and comparisons between modelling and measurements easier. Therefore, the best time to make NO 2 observations is in the early afternoon, as OMI and TROPOMI do. OMI-like spectrograph instruments are also being planned for inclusion on geostationary satellites, such as the Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution ( TEMPO ) mission, the Korean GEMS instrument, the European Sentinel-4 light imaging spectrometer instruments, and NOAA's GeoXO system . OMI-like sensors aboard these spacecraft would potentially give atmospheric scientists the opportunity to acquire measurements 8 to 10 times during the day and follow the diurnal cycle of air pollutants. To intercalibrate the geostationary TEMPO, GEMS, and Sentinel-4 satellites, it is also important to keep the afternoon orbit next to the morning orbit so that there are two points in the diurnal cycle to use in intercalibrating the GEO atmospheric measurements, instead of having only one point in the morning. New instruments aside, there's no question that the eventual end of OMI observations will result in a lot of work to create long-term data records that connect OMI data to that from OMPS and TROPOMI, as well as further back to the GOME and TOMS instruments. \"At the moment, when we see changes, we can compare them to what happened almost 20 years ago, thanks to the instrument being so stable,\" said Tamminen. \"It is not easy to simply put another satellite instrument up and expect it to work like OMI does now. We will need to figure out how to combine and how to continue reliable and consistent datasets from OMI though to the next generation instruments.\" Differences in instrument resolution and calibration among the instruments will need to be examined and accounted for to combine observations made in 2030 with those from 2010. Nevertheless, Tamminen is hopeful FMI will be able to develop long term records of UV index products extending from TOMS, through OMI, to TROPOMI in the hopes of achieving a 40-year record. OMPS data are already being used to advance the total ozone long-term data record that started with TOMS and continued with OMI. Even though OMPS has a larger footprint, the global total ozone data product is expected to be of similar quality. Long-term data records pertaining to trace gasses have proven more challenging, as the differences between the OMI and OMPS instruments are more significant. For now, Levelt advises OMI data users to begin working with OMPS and TROPOMI data while there is still a period of overlap. However, given the differences among products, users are advised to take care in determining which OMPS or TROPOMI data products are best for their application or research. Users can find the information on OMI, OMPS, and TROPOMI data products from NASA’s Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center ( GES DISC ) Distributed Active Archive Center ( DAAC ), which archives and distributes data from NASA's Earth-observing satellites and field measurement programs and provides services to users within the discipline communities. These services include providing complete documentation for available datasets as well as access to subject matter experts who can advise users on research needs, data applications, and accessing, viewing, and manipulating NASA Earth observing data. Products can be accessed as well through the EOSDIS Earthdata Search application by searching with keywords such as \"ozone.\" Image Users can find the information on OMI, OMPS, and TROPOMI data products from NASA’s GES DISC, which processes, archives, and distributes data from NASA's past and current Earth-observing satellites and field measurement programs. GES DISC also provides reliable services to users within the atmospheric data user community. Credit: NASA GES DISC. In addition, near real-time (NRT) OMI and NRT OMPS data products are available through the EOSDIS Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ). While NRT products do not have the extensive processing, quality assurance, or validation required for use in scientific research, they are available within three hours of a sensor observation and are an excellent resource for tracking on-going events or monitoring daily ozone concentrations. Experience with OMI and TROPOMI NRT data has found that the data quality is very good and these data are regularly used for scientific research. (OMI NRT data are also available from KNMI's TEMIS website .) \"OMI and OMPS science quality data products are available usually within 24 hours,\" says James Johnson, GES DISC Scientist for the OMI and OMPS missions. \"Right now, we are receiving Version 3 and the new Version 4 OMI products. Version 4 data is in a new format, netCDF4, which is designed to be compatible with TROPOMI (which is also in netCDF4) and make the transition easier.\" The OMI Version 4 Level 1B products —the calibrated radiances that are the inputs to trace gas retrieval algorithms—are nearly fully reprocessed and should be completed in the next month. Once completed, reprocessing to Level 2 and 3 products can begin. Version 3 is in an older format, but maintains the ability to process consistently from the start of the mission. According to Johnson, there is generally a good mapping between OMI and OMPS products, especially ozone, SO 2 , NO 2 , and aerosols. \"OMPS consists of multiple instruments, a nadir mapper similar to OMI and two vertical profilers on Suomi NPP, and just one vertical profiler on NOAA-20, each with products archived by GES DISC,\" he said. \"In addition, NASA scientists and researchers generate products that combine instrument data from multi-satellites that are also archived by GES DISC. With product names and titles somewhat similar, this can make it confusing to know which products are suitable for your application or research. GES DISC has been developing guidance information and is available to help.\" TROPOMI data are available from ESA's Copernicus Open Access Hub , and through GES DISC, courtesy of an agreement wherein NASA assists with archiving and distributing the instrument's data. A limited amount of TROPOMI L2 NRT data can also be found within three hours after an observation on the TEMIS website. \"NASA's Sentinel Gateway facility retrieves TROPOMI products from ESA and sends the products to the GES DISC,\" said Dr. Feng Ding, GES DISC Data System Engineer specializing in TROPOMI data and services. \"Products are normally available within two to three days of observation.\" ESA released the first TROPOMI ozone profile product on November 16, 2021. Users can access it through the GES DISC website, get it through GES DISC data downloading and subsetting services, and display it with popular visualization tools. \"The best way to find and download these data products is go to the GES DISC website or Earthdata Search, which provides users with product lists, landing pages, and documentation, including data resolution and data coverage information,\" said Ding. Ding also advises users to review the product documentation that GES DISC provides along with any updates, as they may offer important information about changes to the data. For example, ESA changed the instrument's operating configuration in August 2019 to start taking higher-resolution measurements. As of August 6, 2022, there are new versions of the mission's data products. To combine the observations for a long-term record, researchers will need to update data processing to account for the change. As Johnson's and Ding's statements suggest, efforts to extend OMI's 18-year data record to the next generation of instruments are well underway. As they continue, and as scientists find new ways to use and benefit from OMI's long-term observations, the instrument's legacy of helping scientists characterize and identify long-term atmospheric trends in the interest of public health and clean air will live on.

Smith Nov 11, 2022 Image A United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta II rocket carrying the joint NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite lifts off from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on October 28, 2011. Credit: NASA/ULA. The joint NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) satellite launched into space on October 28, 2011. Designed as a bridge mission to provide continuity between NASA’s Earth Observation System ( EOS ) satellites and the next-generation spacecraft of the Joint Polar Satellite System ( JPSS ), Suomi NPP’s successful entry into low Earth orbit paved the way for the launch of NOAA-20 (formerly JPSS-1) on November 18, 2017, and JPSS-2 , which rocketed into space November 10, 2022, and will be known as NOAA-21. Like their EOS predecessors, JPSS satellites collect critical meteorological data for short-term, seasonal, and long-term forecasting; global measurements of atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial conditions; and extend the multidecade data records that enable the study of long-term climate trends. As the first JPSS satellite, Suomi NPP provided nearly an order of magnitude more data than the spacecraft of the EOS system. It also gave NASA and its partner agencies access to and experience with the JPSS' latest and most advanced sensors, thereby facilitating the data continuity efforts associated with the transition from NASA's EOS. In addition, working with Suomi NPP also gave scientists and engineers an opportunity to test the operations systems on the ground and validate sensors and algorithms while the technologies of the current system were still in place. As part of the efforts to validate those new sensors and the algorithms that interpret the data they provide, NASA's Earth Science Data and Information System ( ESDIS ) Project supports five Science Investigator-led Processing Systems ( SIPS ), which are responsible for producing, assessing, processing, and reprocessing products from Suomi NPP's instruments: the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder ( ATMS ), the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System ( CERES ), the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder ( CrIS ), the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite ( OMPS ), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ). Over the years, the SIPS' work has helped NASA and NOAA meet the goals of the Suomi NPP mission and benefitted long-term studies of global change. \"The Suomi NPP SIPS are responsible for processing and reprocessing data products,\" said Evelyn Ho, SIPS Manager for ESDIS. \"They work very closely with the Principal Investigators (PIs) and science team leads (TLs), who develop the algorithms, in testing the updated algorithm in a production-like environment and generating test datasets for evaluation to ensure it produces consistent and good quality data.\" Like all NASA SIPS, the Suomi NPP SIPS are geographically distributed across the United States and are generally (but not always) collocated with the Science Computing Facilities ( SCFs ) that process data from a specific instrument or mission. When a new or reprocessed data product is ready for release, the SIPS sends it to the appropriate NASA Distributed Active Archive Center ( DAAC ) for archiving and distribution. Thanks to the SIPS, data users have more than 10,000 unique data products that are constantly reprocessed and improved to provide the best research-caliber data possible. NASA's five Suomi NPP SIPS are: The Atmosphere SIPS is responsible for the production, processing, reprocessing, and general assessment of Suomi NPP VIIRS Atmosphere Products. It delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to NASA's Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System DAAC ( LAADS DAAC ) via the Land SIPS, the Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC ), the Atmospheric Science Data Center ( ASDC ), and NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE) . The Land SIPS is responsible for the production, processing, reprocessing, and general assessment of the Suomi NPP Science Team standard and experimental VIIRS Land Products. It delivers its data products along with the scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to NASA's LAADS DAAC, National Snow and Ice Data Center DAAC ( NSIDC DAAC ), and Land Processes DAAC ( LP DAAC ). The Ocean SIPS is responsible for producing, processing, reprocessing, and general assessments of Suomi NPP VIIRS Ocean Products. It delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to NASA's Ocean Biology DAAC ( OB.DAAC ). The Ozone SIPS is responsible for processing and reprocessing Suomi NPP OMPS Nadir and Limb products. It delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to the OMPS website and GES DISC. The Sounder SIPS is responsible for the production, processing, and reprocessing of data products from Suomi NPP's ATMS and CrIS, which are collectively referred to as the Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS). It too delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to GES DISC. Image An artist's rendering of the Suomi NPP satellite in low Earth orbit. Credit: JPSS. In addition to these five SIPS, there is the CERES SCF, which is co-located with ASDC and managed and funded by the CERES Principal Investigator. The CERES SCF is responsible for the production, processing, reprocessing, and general assessment of the Suomi NPP Science Team standard and experimental CERES Products. It delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to ASDC. The Suomi NPP SIPS process Level 0 data to Level 2 products and global gridded Level 3 products using the scientific algorithm software from their respective Suomi NPP Discipline Group. Four of the five SIPS acquire near real-time algorithms for selected products and then process and deliver them, within three hours, for distribution through LANCE. The Ocean SIPS, however, acquires near real-time algorithms for selected products and then processes and delivers them, within three hours, for distribution through NASA's Physical Oceanography DAAC ( PO.DAAC ). Given that Suomi NPP has been in orbit for the past 11 years, one might assume the SIPS' work is somewhat routine. Yet, it remains challenging for several reasons, including the variation with which satellite data are received. \"The SIPS work with different external providers for Level 0 data products, ancillary data products, and any additional supporting information that are needed to generate a standard data product,\" said Ho. \"The difficulty is that not all this information is available at the same time.\" Indeed, raw satellite data often arrive at different times and in separate data streams and formats, which requires them to be aligned to meet algorithm requirements. This means the SIPS have to account for the data on each interface and track down missing observations to ensure that processing keeps up with the continuous, operational instrument data flows. In addition, satellites (and the instrument missions they support) frequently enter and exit the EOS constellation, so the SIPS must regularly and quickly incorporate changes to data calibration parameters and algorithms, and reprocess existing data to ensure the accuracy of long-term data records over the life of a mission as well as from one satellite mission to another. \"[The SIPS] provide various tools and applications to support the science teams in monitoring the products and conducting data analysis,\" Ho said. \"They also reprocess the data if the science teams request it, as a result of algorithm or calibration updates. Reprocessing is done to make sure that the records or that data collection is up to date for an entire mission or long-term data record, which is critically important for research.\" This issue is particularly timely now, as NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites have begun their Constellation Exit Maneuvers and the instruments aboard Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, and JPSS-2 become more essential . \"Suomi NPP was meant to bridge the EOS and JPSS missions, so by working with Suomi NPP instruments and data over the years, the PIs and science teams gained early experience with the data from the instruments and their algorithms,\" Ho said. Image This map shows the locations of NASA's five Suomi NPP SIPS and how most, but not all, are collocated with the Scientific Computing Facilities that process data from a specific instrument. Credit: NASA EOSDIS. Elaine Prins, project manager for the Atmosphere SIPS, concurs and says, \"The SIPS have played a pivotal role in meeting the goal of the [Suomi NPP] mission to extend global measurements for long-term monitoring of climate trends that began with NASA's EOS missions and continues into the future with the operational JPSS series.\" According to Prins, the success of the Atmosphere SIPS is rooted in the groundwork, tools, and capabilities developed under the precursor to the SIPS—the NPP Product and Evaluation and Test Elements program—and the relationships honed with a variety of science teams that began in 2007. \"This early work played a significant role in facilitating a smooth transition to the Atmosphere SIPS with a focus on implementing and maintaining an investigator-led processing system,\" she said. \"The Atmosphere SIPS team works collaboratively with the VIIRS Atmosphere science teams on initial planning, scientific algorithm software integration, testing, operational implementation, data ingest monitoring, product generation and delivery, and ongoing evaluation.\" The Atmosphere SIPS ingests Suomi NPP and JPSS VIIRS, CrIS, and other ancillary data 24 hours per day, seven days a week, with global atmosphere products generated in standard processing mode and, for select products, near real-time mode. When science teams deliver updated code with product improvements, the Atmosphere SIPS can reprocess Suomi NPP and JPSS mission records within days to weeks. The SIPS also preserve information about the origins and development of science production software and product generation, which is essential for future researchers and user communities. Hence Prins' assessment that, \"The support and capabilities provided by the SIPS for Suomi NPP and the follow-on JPSS series satellites are crucial for producing high quality consistent multi-decade Earth system data records for global change evaluation studies.\" In this way, the work of the SIPS is also important to NASA's ESDIS Project as a whole, as its mission is to process, archive, and distribute high-quality data to the scientists and others conducting the research required to meet the on-going and complex challenges of climate and environmental change.

Jan 30, 2023 Lori Schultz, Research Physical Scientist and NASA Disasters Program Center Coordinator; NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center Image Lori Schultz is a research physical scientist and Disasters program area center coordinator at Marshall. Credit: Lori Schultz. Research Interests: Finding novel ways to use satellite remote sensing data to answer scientific questions, developing decision-support systems that incorporate NASA Earth science data to meet the needs of users, and applying satellite data to disaster monitoring and mitigation, including the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect and monitor flood and landslide risk. Research Highlights: Without the international constellation of satellites that provide data and imagery of Earth every hour of every day, Lori Schultz, research physical scientist with NASA’s Applied Sciences Program and Center Coordinator of the Disasters program area at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, wouldn’t be able to do her job. Yet, if you talk with Schultz about her work in any detail, she’ll tell you she spends most of her time addressing more human-oriented, down-to-Earth concerns. “I spend a lot of time learning about everyone else’s job and then trying to understand where the data we have to offer fit, or don’t fit, such as the case may be,” said Schultz. “One of the things about working in the applied sciences is that everyone uses data in a slightly different way, so it’s about trying to understand how data are going to work for a particular group.” Schultz describes her work as “finding ways to use satellite remote sensing data to answer science questions,” which is a characterization that supports the NASA Applied Sciences Program's mission to use NASA's unique view from space to address real-world issues. The Applied Sciences Program, which is part of NASA's Earth Science Division , uses global observations from space, air, sea, and land to help people the world over better understand the planet’s interconnected systems. Through its eight program areas —agriculture, capacity building, climate resilience, disasters, ecological conservation, health and air quality, water resources, and wildland fire—the Applied Sciences Program provides funding and support to NASA’s partner organizations (at the state, regional, national, or international levels) who use these observations in response to some of the world’s toughest challenges. As coordinator of the Disasters program area , Schultz and the Marshall team often act as satellite data interpreters who assist personnel from response agencies that reach out to NASA for information and observations in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. In those moments, Schultz and her colleagues review the satellite data and imagery at their disposal to see how these resources might support recovery efforts and how her team can serve as liaisons to those leading response activities on the ground. “If we’re working with [response personnel] during an event, they’ll ask a question and it’s our job to go find the data that answer that question,” said Schultz. “They don’t ask, do you have this? They say, 'I really need to know this.' It’s my job is to have enough knowledge of a lot of different remote sensing applications so, hopefully, we can give them the information they need.” Schultz readily admits that no one dataset is ever going to have all the answers a user is looking for, which is why understanding the work these data users do and the questions they’re trying to answer is so vital to her work. “It’s important to have a relationship with these users, because it helps to know what it is they know and what other data they’re using, and how data we provide could be exploited,” she said. “Sometimes you can’t directly see something, such as a particular area or feature, so a dataset might not give them the exact answer they want. But then we might be able to use four or five datasets to give them more confidence that they’re making the right decision.” Image These before-and-after images show Hurricane Michael's impact on the Gulf Coast of Florida between October 9 and 11, 2019. If you follow along the hurricane’s northeasterly track, you can see that many nighttime lights disappeared after the storm (bottom image). Larger images are available on the Disasters Mapping Portal . Credit: NASA Applied Sciences Program. To help users make those decisions, Schultz and her colleagues rely on a variety of NASA Earth science data, including near real-time ( NRT ) data from NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ). LANCE generates and distributes NRT data and imagery, the majority of which are available within three hours of satellite observation, to support users interested in monitoring a wide variety of natural and human-created phenomena. “The speed with which LANCE distributes its datasets is absolutely spectacular,” said Schultz. “As soon as it becomes available in LANCE, our team here at the Marshall Space Flight Center can process it into products our stakeholders can use and distribute it to them. That’s an amazing thing. As the datasets are usually in science formats, there is some work for the Disasters program team to provide them through the Disasters portal in a user-ready format, but NASA DAACs [Distributed Active Archive Centers] and LANCE are moving in that direction more and more, as exemplified by the FIRMS [NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management] website. It is very encouraging to be part of expanding the use of NASA data to a broader audience.\" In fact, in addition to her work with the Applied Sciences Program, Schultz serves as a member of the LANCE User Working Group ( UWG ), which provides recommendations concerning a broad range of topics related to LANCE systems, capabilities, and services. In this role, she has the opportunity to assist LANCE as it works to enhance and expand its NRT data offerings. Schultz regularly uses the NRT imagery available in NASA Worldview and FIRMS to give stakeholders a sense of both the information different NASA datasets provide and how data from multiple sources might be used together. “I frequently use Worldview to demonstrate a particular dataset and let stakeholders see what it shows over a particular period of time so they can see if information it provides is useful or valuable to them,” Schultz said. “I’ve used the FIRMS webpage a lot because I love how it offers a variety of optical data, and I can use it to show how data from several sources can be layered.” Among the datasets Schultz and her team in the Disasters program use most frequently are true-color imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) instrument aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System spacecraft, and reflectance imagery from the Operational Land Imager ( OLI ) aboard the joint NASA/ USGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites and the Multi-Spectral Instrument ( MSI ) aboard the ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. “MODIS and VIIRS are workhorses for big-picture looks, barring any cloud cover,” Schultz said. “Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B and Landsat 8 and 9 are also right up there, as we get to take advantage of their 30-meter resolution, despite the tradeoff of not getting a look every day.” Schultz and Disasters program staff also regularly use MODIS Global Flood Products, which provide daily global flood maps based on MODIS imagery; VIIRS Day/Night band imagery, which is ultra-sensitive in low-light conditions and enables observations of nighttime lights—information that is useful for gauging the impact of and recovery from severe weather; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets from MODIS and VIIRS, which provide information on vegetation health that farmers and resource managers can use to monitor the health and development of crops and fields during growing seasons; and SAR data from Sentinel-1 and other space-based and airborne sources. Unlike optical data from instruments like MODIS and VIIRS, SAR uses the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, so it can penetrate cloud cover and \"see” in the dark and through inclement weather conditions, thereby enabling observations of flood inundation, land cover changes, and modifications of Earth's surface from earthquakes and landslides. Image As part of her work, Schultz frequently trains personnel from first response teams on integrating Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) data products into their workflow. Credit: Lori Schultz. In 2021, Schultz and her Disaster’s program colleagues worked with personnel from public health and safety agencies in North Carolina to demonstrate how datasets like these can help the state respond to and even prepare for disasters during North Carolina’s annual hurricane exercise. It was not the first time the Disasters program worked with North Carolina’s emergency response teams. A year earlier, in November 2020, the state’s emergency managers reached out to the Disasters program to better understand how NASA satellite data could help determine floodwater extent in the aftermath of Hurricane Eta, which flooded roads, damaged infrastructure, and led to the deaths of at least four people. In response, Schultz and her team developed false-color maps of the region that enabled officials to pinpoint the buildings and roads most at risk in the days before flood levels reached their peak. Having worked with the state's emergency teams before, Schultz and her colleagues knew the state had extensive flood monitoring capabilities. So, during the hurricane exercise, Schultz and her team focused their efforts on showing state employees how NASA satellite data could help them more quickly and accurately assess the amount and location of flooding. “The public safety agencies are the experts in emergency response , but they can’t be expected to be experts in all of our satellite data,” Schultz noted in an article on the Applied Sciences website about the Disaster program area’s participation in the exercise. “We learned they have tremendous modeling and remote sensing capabilities, but could use NASA’s help to use satellite data to find flooding. So, we built a flood mapping portal for them to use during the exercise to demonstrate what’s possible.” Providing such insights before severe weather occurs is important, for when disaster strikes there’s no time to wonder what type of information might be helpful to those directing first responders in the field. Further, as climate change continues to increase the frequency and severity of storms, North Carolina and other states in the Southeastern United States can expect to experience more floods in the coming years. So, too, can places in other flood-prone regions of the world, such as the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region of India, where hydro-climatic disasters in the form of seasonal, riverine, and flash floods occur frequently along the rivers and tributaries during monsoon season. Every year, destructive floods result in the loss of lives and livelihoods and cause severe damage to infrastructure and property, but because the region’s floods cannot be totally controlled, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ( ICIMOD ) has directed its response efforts toward reducing flood vulnerability and mitigating flood impacts through improved flood risk management and end-to-end flood forecasting and warning services. To assist ICIMOD in meeting these goals, Schultz worked with members of a SERVIR Applied Sciences Team led by Dr. Franz Meyer, Chief Scientist at the Alaska Satellite Facility , on a three-year project to develop a flood inundation portal. Using SAR data from the Sentinel-1 satellite, the portal documents the location and extent of floods caused by the latest monsoons—timely and accurate information local agencies can use to inform their flood relief activities. (Note: The SERVIR Applied Sciences Team is part of the larger SERVIR network, which is a joint development initiative of the United States Agency for International Development and NASA.) “We used SAR data in the Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region because there are so many clouds and they really can’t use the standard optical data to see how the water in their region is changing,” said Schultz. Image This image from the ICIMOD Flood Inundation Mapping portal shows the extent of flooding during monsoon season in the HKH region. Dark blue colors indicate perennial water bodies; light blue colors indicate areas of flooding. Credit: SERVIR. “Now the team at ICIMOD is beginning to use these data to validate forecast models that were developed before the project began, track how the water is moving through the area during monsoon season, and identify areas that are more at risk,\" Schultz said. While such results are certainly good news for the people of the HKH region, the SERVIR project’s success in applying SAR data to flooding applications appears to be benefitting emergency response efforts in the U.S. as well. “We applied the same algorithms that we used in the HKH region to detect floods after hurricanes that hit the East Coast,” said Schultz. “I’ve made maps of flooding from Hurricane Ian and Nicole with SAR data using these same techniques, and I was able to get them to [the] Federal Emergency Management Agency within three hours of getting the data.” As these advances suggest, the free and open Earth science data available through NASA’s LANCE and the DAACs are essential for not only providing disaster response organizations with the information they need to safeguard human life and critical infrastructure, they are key inputs in the development of new technologies and techniques that scientists like Schultz, humanitarian organizations, and government agencies will use to improve the detection, response, and mitigation of natural disasters the world over.

LANCE (Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS) is a group of near real-time data systems serving the Land and Atmosphere science community. What is near real-time (NRT) data? Near real-time data are defined as data that are available to users three hours or less after a satellite observation. What near real-time systems are a part of LANCE? LANCE consists of \"elements\" that process the NRT data made available through LANCE. These are listed in the table below. LANCE Element Processing Center Instrument LANCE MODIS MODAPS (Goddard) MODIS LANCE AMSR AMSR SIPS (GHRC) AMSR2 LANCE AIRS GES DISC (Goddard) AIRS LANCE MLS MLS SIPS (Jet Propulsion Laboratory [JPL]) MLS LANCE OMI Ozone SIPS (Goddard) OMI LANCE MISR MISR SIPS (JPL) MISR LANCE VIIRS - Atmosphere Suomi NPP Atmosphere SIPS (SSEC, University of Wisconsin-Madison) VIIRS LANCE VIIRS - Land Suomi NPP Land SIPS (Goddard) VIIRS LANCE OMPS Ozone SIPS (Goddard) OMPS LANCE MOPITT MOPITT SIPS (NCAR) MOPITT LANCE LIS (ISS) AMSR SIPS (GHRC) ISS What are standard products? Standard products are products that are used for standard science processing and are generally available between 8-40 hours after observation. What is the difference between near real-time and standard products? Near real-time and standard products differ in the amount of processing the raw data receives. Near real-time data is processed with different, less accurate ancillary data to make it available to users within 3 hours of observation. The main difference is in geolocation due to the use of predictive orbit information vs waiting for definitive orbit information. Where can I obtain standard products? Each LANCE element provides standard products as well as near real-time products. Go to the Standard Products page for the data centers where the standard products are archived. What LANCE data products are available? Currently the following near real-time products are available under LANCE: Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS ), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 ( AMSR2 ), Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on the International Space Station - LIS (ISS) , Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MISR ), Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS ), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ), Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere ( MOPITT ), Ozone Monitoring Instrument ( OMI ), Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite ( OMPS ), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS-Land ) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS-Atmosphere ).

For both MODIS and VIIRS, the Corrected Reflectance algorithm utilizes Level 1B data (the calibrated, geolocated radiances). It is not a standard, science quality product and is available only as near real-time imagery. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview and GIBS. For MODIS, the sensor resolution is 500 m and 250 m (Bands 1 and 2 have a sensor resolution of 250 m, Bands 3 – 7 have a sensor resolution of 500m, and Bands 8 - 36 are 1 km. Band 1 is used to sharpen Band 3, 4, 6, and 7), imagery resolution is 250 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.The purpose of this algorithm is to provide natural-looking images by removing gross atmospheric effects, such as Rayleigh scattering, from MODIS visible bands 1-7. The algorithm was developed by the original MODIS Rapid Response team to address the needs of the fire monitoring community who want to see smoke. Corrected Reflectance shows smoke more clearly than the standard Surface Reflectance product. In contrast, the MODIS Land Surface Reflectance product (MOD09) is a more complete atmospheric correction algorithm that includes aerosol correction, and is designed to derive land surface properties. In clear atmospheric conditions, the Corrected Reflectance product is very similar to the MOD09 product, but they depart from each other in presence of aerosols. If you wish to perform a complete atmospheric correction, please do not use the Corrected Reflectance algorithm. An additional difference is that the Land Surface Reflectance product is only tuned for calculating the reflectance over land surfaces. The VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery provides continuity from the MODIS Corrected Reflectance imagery and was developed to provide natural-looking images by removing gross atmospheric effects such as Rayleigh scattering from the visible bands. By contrast, the Surface Reflectance product is available in near real-time and as a standard product. Surface Reflectance provides a more complete atmospheric correction algorithm that includes aerosol correction and is designed to derive land surface properties. In clear atmospheric conditions the corrected reflectance product is similar to the Surface Reflectance product but they depart from each other in the presence of aerosols. MODIS Near Real-Time Data What is MODIS? MODIS stands for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The MODIS instrument is aboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. The orbit of the Terra satellite goes from north to south across the equator in the morning and Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon resulting in global coverage every 1 to 2 days. The EOS satellites have a ±55 degree scanning pattern and orbit at 705 km with a 2,330 km swath width.The MODIS instrument provides 36 spectral bands from wavelengths of 0.4µm to 14.4µm. For more information, please visit the NASA MODIS website . When were the Terra and Aqua satellites launched? Terra (EOS AM) was launched 18 December 1999 and Aqua (EOS PM) was launched 4 May 2002. High quality hotspot/active fire observations are available from the Terra satellite starting November 2000 and from the Aqua satellite starting 4 July 2002 onwards. What time does the satellite pass over my area? Terra (EOS AM) passes over the equator at approximately 10:30 am and 10:30 pm each day, Aqua (EOS PM) satellite passes over the equator at approximately 1:30 pm and 1:30 am. The sun-synchronous orbit allows the satellites to pass over the same area at the same time in every 24 hour period (at every 99 minute orbit the satellites cross the equator at the above mentioned times; every other spot on Earth has similarly constant overpass times). The time of satellite pass will vary according to your location. To estimate when the satellite will pass over your area, you can use the satellite overpass predictor provided by NASA. Daily Terra and Aqua global and regional orbit tracks are provided by the Space Science and Engineering Center ( SSEC ) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . The maps show a series of white lines with tic marks showing what time the satellite will pass over a certain location on the Earth. The white lines represent the center of the swath and the tic marks and time show at what time in UTC the satellite has passed over that location. Image A cut-away from an orbit track map showing the Terra satellite overpass time near the Great Lakes (daytime granule starting at 17:10 UTC, nighttime granule starting at 03:35 UTC). The maps have a series of white lines with tick marks on them that show what time (using Coordinated Universal Time , or UTC) the satellite will be passing over a particular location on Earth on a given day. The white lines represent the center of the swath. The time stamps mark the start of the northern (Terra) or southern (Aqua) edge of each 5-minute data collection period. An image acquired at that location will span roughly 1150 kilometers on either side of the tick mark. Every day there are two passes over most areas: one daylight pass, and one nighttime pass. How often are data acquired? The MODIS instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua EOS satellites acquire data continuously providing global coverage every 1-2 days. Therefore there are at least 4 daily MODIS observations for almost every area on the equator – with the number of overpasses increasing (due to overlapping orbits) the closer an area is to the poles. See What time does the satellite pass over my area? What are MODIS Data \"Collections\"? A MODIS data Collection is a MODIS data version. When new and improved science algorithms are developed, the entire MODIS dataset (from launch) is reprocessed and then tagged and distributed as a new \"Collection\". During the process of a Collection, an attempt is made to use the same version of the Science Algorithms or Program Executables (PGEs). However, sometimes a bug is found in one or more of the PGEs in the middle of Collection processing; and if the bug is not serious, processing will complete with the new corrected PGE. These anomalies and problems in processing are noted on the Known Problems page. One can always identify the Collection number for a particular HDF file as it's always included (as a 3 digit number) as part of the HDF filename. There have been six MODIS data Collections (or Versions) processed since MODIS/Terra was launched in early 2000. The Collection versions created thus far are 001, 003, 004, 005, 051, 006 and 06.1. MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1) was added in October 2017 to correct a number of issues in the Collection 6 (C6) Level-1B (L1B) data. The decision to create a new improved C6.1 was driven by the MODIS Atmosphere team to address a number of issues in the current C6 L1B data. These L1B issues had a negative impact in varying degrees in downstream MODIS Atmosphere Level-2 (L2) and Level-3 (L3) products. More information can be found at the MODIS Atmosphere website . Starting in November 2017, C6 Land processing stream will use the C6.1 L1B as input, with no change to the land-science processing algorithms. We do not expect to see any significant impact to most land products from using upstream C6.1 as inputs except for some minor differences in Terra MODIS snow and sea-ice products because of differences in the Terra cloud mask. Therefore, C6 processing of NRT Terra- and Aqua-MODIS Land products will continue until sometime around the middle of 2018, when C6.1 processing of Land products will start. VIIRS Near Real Time Data What is VIIRS? Image The VIIRS pixel footprint size projected onto the Earth increases away from nadir. VIIRS stands for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The VIIRS sensor was launched aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) satellite on October 28th, 2011 and again on the NOAA-20 / Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1) satellite. (Note: JPSS-1 was renamed NOAA-20 after launch). Suomi NPP crosses the equator at approximately 13:30 PM (ascending node) and 1.30 AM (descending node). NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) leads Suomi NPP by a half orbit so it crosses the equator approximately 50 minutes earlier. The 3,040 km VIIRS swath enables ~15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator, thereby providing full global coverage every 12 hours and mid-latitudes will experience 3-4 looks a day. VIIRS has 5 high resolution imagery channels (I-bands), 16 moderate resolution channels (M-bands) and a Day/Night Band (DNB). The VIIRS detectors have a constant angular resolution that results in an increasing pixel footprint size as the scan is further from nadir (see figure 1 below). This means the actual area of each scan has the shape of a bow-tie, as consecutive scans overlap away from nadir. The bow-tie effect is reduced during processing through a combination of aggregation and deletion of overlapping pixels. What VIIRS products are available in LANCE? The VIIRS I-band (375 m) Active Fire product and Corrected Reflectance imagery are the newest near real-time products available through LANCE. More will follow. The active fire product will be available in FIRMS and images created from these data products, and Corrected Reflectance images are now available through GIBS for viewing using EOSDIS Worldview and similar clients. The new VIIRS images available through GIBS are Corrected Reflectance (True Color; Bands M3, I3, and M11; and Bands M11, I2, and I1) and Fires and Thermal Anomalies (Day/Night).

Here’s a look at 10 LANCE milestones over the past decade. author-share Joshua C. Blumenfeld Oct 30, 2019 Since 2009, the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS), or LANCE , has been providing data and data products generally within three hours of a satellite observation. The products, services, and data distribution strategies developed by the LANCE team have helped transform not only how Earth observing data are used, but also the worldwide accessibility of these data. As LANCE enters its second decade, it’s worth looking back at 10 LANCE milestones. While this list is not meant to be all-inclusive, it provides an overview of how this major initiative evolved to provide data from instruments aboard Earth observing satellites rapidly, accurately, and consistently. 1. Development of the NRTPE and Rapid Response, the precursors to LANCE The evolution of what would become known as LANCE began in 2001 with the development of the NASA/NOAA/Department of Defense Near Real-Time Processing Effort (NRTPE). At the request of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), NASA’s Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project collaborated with the USFS and the University of Maryland Department of Geography to create a system called Rapid Response using the NRTPE feed as a foundation. Rapid Response provided access to near real-time imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua Earth observing satellites to support wildfire suppression and response. 2. Establishment of LANCE in 2009 By 2008, a growing demand for near real-time data spurred a NASA Headquarters-led effort to build a new, more robust system to process and distribute near real-time data. In July 2009, the ESDIS Project led the development of a new near real-time system serving data from not only the MODIS instrument, but also the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard NASA’s Aqua satellite, the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard NASA’s Aura satellite, and, soon afterward, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) aboard Aqua. This new system was formally established by NASA in September 2009 and named “LANCE.” 3. User/Community Feedback Mechanisms Established In December 2009 the ESDIS Project held a workshop to better understand the needs of LANCE users and to nominate the first members of a new LANCE User Working Group (UWG). This advisory group provides guidance and recommendations concerning topics related to the LANCE system, capabilities, and services and represents the needs of the LANCE applications user communities. The ESDIS Project conducted an informal survey of LANCE users in 2012 to better understand user needs and solicit feedback on improvements to better serve near real-time applications. Formal user surveys were conducted in 2013 and 2016. 4. Rapid Response Integrated with LANCE in 2011 After its establishment in 2001, Rapid Response remained a stand-alone system. Between 2004 and 2011, new MODIS spectral band combinations were implemented to enhance snow/ice, floods, and burn scars. Recognizing the importance of near real-time imagery for users who lived in areas with low internet bandwidth service, the MODIS Rapid Response system was incorporated into LANCE in February 2011. The Rapid Response system was phased out in 2019 and replaced with Worldview Snapshots . 5. The Development of GIBS and NASA Worldview Powered by LANCE (2011) Image Screenshot of the first Worldview test home page on December 3, 2011. NASA Worldview image. MODIS Rapid Response demonstrated not only the ability to provide near real-time imagery, but also the value of quick and simple access to this imagery. The next step in LANCE’s development was the creation of a way for data users to easily download near real-time imagery, interactively explore this imagery, and download the underlying data behind this imagery. The results of these efforts were the development of the LANCE-powered Global Imagery Browse Services ( GIBS ) and the NASA Worldview interactive data visualization application in 2011. GIBS and NASA Worldview were game-changers in the way near real-time imagery were distributed and used, and provided users with quick and easy access to daily, global imagery in near real-time. 6. Development of FIRMS Image Each orange dot on this FIRMS Fire Map from October 30, 2019, indicates a MODIS-detected hotspot, which may be a wildfire. NASA FIRMS image. The Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ), initially developed at the University of Maryland, was transitioned to LANCE in May 2010, and became formally operational in LANCE in May 2012. FIRMS provides near real-time thermal anomaly data (including an approximate location of a detected hotspot) from the MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments. Global active fire detections can be viewed interactively using the FIRMS Fire Map application, and FIRMS users can sign up to receive email Fire Alerts notifying them of potential fires detected in specific areas of interest. Through this free service, alerts can be received in near real-time or as daily or weekly summaries. Every week approximately 240,000 FIRMS alerts (including daily alerts, Rapid Alerts, and weekly alerts) are sent to users in more than 160 countries, according to the FIRMS team. 7. Improvements in Near Real-Time Data Latency and Reliability The overall LANCE objective is to provide near real-time data and imagery generally within three hours of an instrument observation. NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Operations System ( EDOS ) is the primary provider of all LANCE instrument data directly downloaded from NASA EOS satellites like Terra, Aqua, and Aura. In 2011, EDOS made significant enhancements to the way these data were streamed from ground stations and also improved the way these data were processed and prioritized, which helped reduce the latency for data delivered to LANCE. Today, most LANCE products are available to data users less than three hours after an observation, with some products being available less than two hours after acquisition. 8. First non-EOS mission instrument data added to LANCE in 2015 The addition of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Global Change Observation Mission-Water (GCOM-W1) satellite in March 2015 was the first non-EOS mission data added to LANCE. Currently, six unique AMSR2 data products are available through LANCE. 9. Significant growth in data available through LANCE The addition of AMSR2 near real-time data was followed by the addition of data from several more instruments, including: Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aboard NASA’s Terra satellite; June 2016 Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) aboard Terra; October 2017 VIIRS aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite; first of several data products added February 2016 Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) aboard Suomi NPP; December 2017 VIIRS aboard the joint NASA/NOAA NOAA-20 satellite; August 2019 Along with new instrument data, new data products are constantly being added to the system. Recent additions include: VIIRS Nighttime Imagery product; January 2017 MODIS Global Near Real-Time Flood Product; approved in April 2017 OMPS Pyrocumulonimbus product (PyroCb); October 2018 MODIS Thermal Alert System (MODVOLC); produced in 2019 by LANCE from MODIS data to serve the volcano monitoring community and distributed primarily through the University of Hawaii MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC); produced in 2019 by LANCE to support the air quality and climate/atmospheric modeling communities 10. Addition of first International Space Station mission data in 2018 The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) was installed on the International Space Station in February 2017. LANCE LIS near-real time data are available within two minutes of observation and provide total lightning measurements between +/- 48 degrees latitude, a geographic range that includes nearly all global lightning.

Several factors affect the speed at which data are processed and made available to users. Here's how NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) defines data latency. When a major fire starts in a forest, emergency responders and resource managers need data fast. Data providers use terms such as near real-time and low latency to refer to data provided to users quickly, but what do these terms mean? NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) distributes a wide range of data products to global data users, including satellite observations, imagery, airborne observations, field data, and data published by scientists. Some of these data are available to users within hours. Other data products require extensive processing before they are useful. Data latency is the total time elapsed between when data are acquired by a sensor and when these data are made available to the public. Image Red dots in this image indicate the location of MODIS-detected hotspots on August 20, 2020, from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ), which distributes MODIS and VIIRS near real-time active fire data within three hours of a satellite observation. Credit: NASA FIRMS. NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ) distributes near real-time active fire data within three hours of satellite observation from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and the joint NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. While it is important for emergency responders to have data as quickly as possible, several factors affect the speed at which data are processed and made available to users. Data Latency Terminology NASA and other Earth science data providers use different terminology to describe data latency. The terms near real-time (NRT), low latency, and expedited are often used interchangeably to refer to data that are made available more quickly than routine processing allows. In 2016, a workshop titled “Time Sensitive Applications of NASA Data” was held at NASA's Langley Research Center to identify, coordinate, and focus attention on low-latency satellite data. At this workshop the terms for latency were defined and agreed to by participants across NASA for all data managed by EOSDIS on behalf of NASA’s Earth Science Division. The table below summarizes these terms. Term Latency Purpose Real-time Less than 1 hour These terms are often used to refer to data that are made available quicker than routine processing allows. They are used for a range of applied sciences, decision and tactical support, monitoring and early warning of events. Near real-time (NRT) 1-3 hours Low latency 3-24 hours Expedited 1-4 days Standard routine processing Generally, 8 – 40 hours but up to 2 months for some higher-level products Standard products provide an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earth’s geophysical properties to support science. A new data latency product called ultra real-time (URT) has recently been added to FIRMS. URT MODS and VIIRS thermal anomaly products are available within 60 seconds of acquisition via direct download for display on the FIRMS Fire Map. Note that URT has not been adopted as a formal latency designation by EOSDIS. For more information about URT data in FIRMS, please see FIRMS Adds Ultra Real-Time Data from MODIS and VIIRS and Wildfire Detection in the U.S. and Canada Within a Minute of Satellite Observation . Low-latency data products are made available more quickly than standard processing to support users interested in monitoring a wide variety of natural and man-made phenomena. In the context of NASA data, low latency products are distinct from standard data products in that the algorithms for low latency products are modified to expedite data availability.

One key difference between some NRT and standard products is that NRT data use predictive orbit information for geolocation instead of definitive orbit information, which may not be available until after the NRT products are produced. A second key difference applies to NRT products that make use of ancillary data as part of the processing algorithm from sources other than the satellite. These ancillary data are combined with the satellite data to create higher-level products. Some algorithms for NRT data products use different or less accurate ancillary data than standard products. Standard products are processed using definitive geolocation and instrument calibration, and provide an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of Earth’s geophysical properties to support scientific research. These science-quality standard data products require routine processing, which takes time. They are typically made available between eight hours to two months from data acquisition. If latency is not a primary concern, users are encouraged to use the standard science products. EOSDIS data products are processed at various levels ranging from level 0 to level 4. Level 0 products are raw data at full instrument resolution. At higher levels, the data are converted into more useful parameters and formats. NRT data are often provided at level 0, 1, and 2, and some level 3 products. Level Name Processing Level Level 0 Level 0 data products are reconstructed, unprocessed instrument/payload data at full resolution; any and all communications artifacts, e.g., synchronization frames, communications headers, duplicate data removed. Level 1A Level 1A data products are reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced, and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters, e.g., platform ephemeris, computed and appended but not applied to the Level 0 data. Level 1B Level 1A data that have been processed to sensor units (not all instruments will have a Level 1B equivalent). Level 2 Level 2 data products are derived geophysical variables at the same resolution and location as the Level 1 source data. Level 3 Level 3 data products are variables mapped on uniform space-time grid scales, usually with some completeness and consistency. Level 4 Level 4 data products are model output or results from analyses of lower level data, e.g., variables derived from multiple measurements.

The clouds over land show sensitivity to different GDAS ancillary input data. Science quality, or higher-level “standard” data products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earth’s geophysical properties to support science. They are made available within 8-40 hours of satellite observation. If latency is not a primary concern, users are encouraged to use the standard science products, which are created using the best available ancillary, calibration and ephemeris information. Standard products corresponding to the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) (LANCE) near real-time (NRT) products are archived as follows: AIRS and MLS standard products are available through NASA's Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center ( GES DISC ). AMSR SIPS generates AMSR2 standard science quality data products and they are available at NASA's National Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center ( NSIDC DAAC ). Lightning Imaging Sensor on ISS (ISS LIS) standard products are available from NASA’s Global Hydrometeorology Resource Center DAAC ( GHRC DAAC ) Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer ( MISR ) standard products are available from NASA's Atmospheric Sciences Data Center ( ASDC ). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) standard atmosphere and L1 products are available through NASA's Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) DAAC ( LAADS DAAC ). MODIS standard land products are available from NASA's Land Processes DAAC ( LP DAAC ) and NSIDC DAAC (snow and ice). OMI standard products are available through GES DISC. OMPS standard products are available through GES DISC. VIIRS land products standard are available from LP DAAC and NSIDC DAAC (snow and ice). VIIRS-Atmosphere standard products are available through NASA's Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center ( LAADS DAAC ) via NASA's Suomi NPP Land SIPS . Comparisons Between the NRT and Standard Products AIRS NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS ) NRT data products are identical to the AIRS routine products except for the following. The AIRS NRT products are produced: The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes (previous and subsequent granules are used for calibration and are generally present in 5 minutes). Predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used (in contrast, definitive ephemeris/attitude data are used for processing standard products). Nominally, a forecast surface pressure is used; if this is unavailable, a surface climatology is then used. No ice cloud properties retrievals are performed (ice cloud properties are a new retrieval in the Version 6 support product AIRX2SUP ). These differences have the following implications for the AIRS NRT Level 1B and Level 2 products. Level 1B - The atmospheric surface pressure is not used in Level 1B processing, the AIRS Level 1b radiance data produced in the NRT system are nearly identical to the routinely processed AIRS data. There may be small differences in the geolocation (i.e., longitude and latitude). Also, since the NRT system does not wait as long for the previous or subsequent granule data to be present before processing there may be small differences in the radiances of NRT data that were processed without the previous or subsequent granules. This can happen when AIRS is entering or leaving the range of a downlink station (usually are 17 times/day). The reason for the differences is because the standard product uses the space view offset from the previous and subsequent granules for calibration purposes. Level 2 - The AIRS Level 2 NRT retrieval products can differ from the routine products because of small differences in assumed surface pressure and/or differences in the radiances. Although it is rare, if the forecast surface pressure is not available when the NRT data are produced the NRT algorithm assumes a surface pressure based on a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) rather than the more accurate forecast surface pressure. The differences in the assumed surface pressure tend to be small (~ 10 mbar) near the equator but can become larger (~ 70 mbar) near synoptic weather events. The pressure differences can also lead to differences in the retrieved temperature and water vapor. For more information, please read the following document, AIRS NRT data products: May 10, 2010 , describing the difference between AIRS NRT and Standard Products. Back to top AMSR2 NRT The LANCE system provides access to near real-time data (less than 3 hours from observation). Users, operational agencies and researchers utilize these products for a wide range of purposes (weather forecasting to monitoring natural hazards). These users often need data much sooner than routine science processing allows and are willing to trade science quality for timely access. Science quality products should be used for latency independent research and applications. The AMSR SIPS generates AMSR2 standard science quality data products and they are available at NSIDC DAAC. Back to top LIS NRT (ISS) Near real-time (NRT), non-quality controlled (NQC) standard data products, and quality controlled (QC) standard data products from the LIS (ISS) are available from NASA's Global Hydrometeorology Resource Center ( GHRC DAAC ) and the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ) system. These data are available in both HDF-4 and netCDF-4 formats, with corresponding browse images in GIF format. LANCE LIS (ISS) NRT data are available rapidly after an observation (generally within two minutes), and are an excellent resource for applications requiring low data latency, such as tracking on-going severe storms or tracking lightning over oceans and other data-sparse regions. Standard data products, on the other hand, are created daily after all raw observations for the day have been acquired and are more complete than NRT data. The LIS (ISS) Quality Controlled (QC) standard data products have extensive processing, quality assurance reviews, and validation and should be used in scientific research. Back to top MISR NRT Differences between MISR Level 1 NRT Radiances and Level 1 Standard Products MISR Level 1 NRT radiance products contain the same content as the standard products. However, changes were made to the code to allow the L1 processing to deal with the session-based MISR L0 data and the Terra attitude data that goes along with this L0 data. Level 1 Near Real-Time The MISR NRT Level 1 data products consist of radiance measurements organized in 10-50 minute sessions representing a portion of a single MISR orbit. Measurements are obtained throughout the 380 km MISR swath and projected onto a Space-Oblique Mercator (SOM) map grid. The Ellipsoid-projected and Terrain-projected top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance products provide measurements respectively resampled onto the WGS84 reference ellipsoid and onto the topography of a digital elevation model. Spatial sampling is 275 m in all bands of MISR’s nadir camera, and in the red band of the other eight (off-nadir) cameras. The remaining channels are sampled at 1.1 km. Level 2 Near Real-Time MISR Level 2 NRT Products are geophysical measurements derived in near real time from Level 1 NRT products. MISR Level 2 NRT Cloud Motion Vector (CMV) datasets are distributed as BUFR and HDF format files within 3 hours of satellite overflight. Product data is organized in 10-50 minute sessions representing a portion of a single MISR orbit. Parameters are projected onto a SOM map grid and defined throughout the 380 km wide MISR swath. At present, available Level 2 NRT products include two formats of the MISR Level 2 CMV product, comprising height-resolved cloud motions representative of the wind field. The CMV product is analogous to the MISR Level 3 CMV product offered in standard production. MISR BUFR format files have been verified to be compatible with the ECMWF BUFRDC 000400 library and the NCEP BUFRLIB v10-2-3 library. Differences between MISR Level 2 NRT CMV and Level 3 Standard Products MISR Level 2 NRT CMV products are intended to contain nearly equivalent science information as L3 MISR CMV product files produced with monthly and seasonal file granularity. The cloud-tracking and reconstruction algorithms of each are equivalent, except for the following details: Whereas the L3 CMV product includes in the product only wind speeds up to speeds of 50 ms-1, the Level 2 NRT CMV product includes wind speeds up to 100 ms-1. Wind speeds greater than 50 ms-1 were originally excluded from the L3 CMV product because they can only be obtained for wind orientations aligned with the ground track of the satellite. The potential sampling bias associated with this limitation is less relevant for rapid response applications. For data sessions in which fewer than 1000 valid retrievals are obtained prior to quality filtering, all retrievals will be omitted on the basis that insufficient data is available to perform necessary checks on the accuracy of camera pointing information. Level 2 NRT CMV products provide a nominal 75% of the coverage provided by Level 3 CMV products. Level 3 CMV product datasets are distributed as NetCDF format files comprising data collected over the course of a month, season, or year. Level 2 NRT CMVs are derived from data sessions typically comprising less than the full orbit employed by standard process. Level 2 NRT CMV product datasets are generated by a separate implementation of the same algorithms used for standard products that yields nearly equivalent results. Differences are due to the nature of NRT processing and fall within the expected uncertainty of the retrieval. For more information about Level 2 CMVs, please read section 2 of the following document, JPL D-74995 Data Product Specification for the MISR Cloud Motion Vector Product . Additional information about the difference between the MISR NRT and standard products is available in the Data Quality Summary for L2 CMV NRT Product and L3 CMV Product . Differences between MISR Level 2 NRT Aerosols and Level 2 Standard Products A paper that describes the development of the new NRT aerosol product and summarizes the differences between the NRT and the standard aerosol products has been accepted for publication in the journal Atmospheric Measurement Techniques and is available at https://amt.copernicus.org/preprints/amt-2021-71/ . The MISR NRT aerosol products contain information on atmospheric aerosols, including optical depth, single scattering albedo, Angstrom exponent, and aerosol size. The MISR NRT retrieval strategy builds upon the MISR standard aerosol algorithm. NRT employs the same ancillary datasets as the initial FIRSTLOOK version of the standard product that is available within 2 days from acquisition. The key difference between the standard and NRT processing is in cloud screening: the NRT algorithm does not have access to cloud classifiers that are available in the standard algorithm, and which are generated during Level 1 and Level 2 cloud processing. As a result, in the NRT algorithm, a threshold on the Aerosol Retrieval Confidence Index (ARCI) was adjusted to 0.18; the equivalent ARCI threshold in the FIRSTLOOK and standard processing is 0.15. Information about this product and details about product quality are available on the MISR Data and Information Table. Back to top MLS NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. For detailed information on MLS NRT data product quality, please see the user guide. The MLS NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet NRT data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products. Nevertheless the results are scientifically useful in selected regions of the earth's atmosphere provided that the data are screened according to the recommendations in the MLS NRT user guide. The NRT data are typically available within 3 hours of observation and are broken into files containing about 15 minutes of data. The 7 most recent days of MLS NRT data are kept online for users to download. After this time users should download the standard, full production Level-2 data products. Back to top MODIS NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. Near Real-Time Approach The delivery of the Level 0 (L0) is expedited from the EOS Data and Operations System (EDOS). NRT processing acquires L0 files at the end of each downlink session (session-based files) within 10-30 minutes of real-time, whereas standard forward processing acquires 2-hour L0 files for Aqua and Terra within 7-8 hours of real-time. For geolocation MODIS Terra and MODIS Aqua differ in their approach. For MODIS Terra the attitude and ephemeris data entrained in the L0 data are used rather than the flight data (FD) product for standard processing. The Aqua sensor (unlike Terra) lacks the ability to generate definitive ephemeris and attitude data, and therefore, NASA's Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) calculates predicted satellite ephemeris data and uploads it to the spacecraft once per day. This data is later returned to the ground stations as Ground-Based Attitude Determination (GBAD) data, which is also time-coordinated with the other instruments. This GBAD ephemeris and attitude data is used to process Aqua MODIS standard products. Most NRT Product Generation Executive (PGE) codes use the same science algorithm used in the standard processing. However, certain Level 2 (L2) codes have modified production rules to relax the requirements for ancillary data products. For Level 3, rolling products such as MOD141N/Q1N, MxD09A1N, MCD43A1N/A2/A2N download this PDF to explain the differences between the NRT and standard \"n-day\" products. Image In this side-by-side comparison of a standard and near-real time Land Surface Reflectance granule over the Midwest there appears to be no difference between the products. However, under close examination the near-real time view shows slightly more haze West of the Great Lakes. To meet the latency requirement, most L2 NRT Atmosphere PGEs (Cloud Mask/Profile, Cloud, and Aerosol) are allowed to use ancillary input products (e.g. GDAS, NISE, OZONE, TOAST) from an earlier time period, and sometime even several days prior to the current data day while the operational processing could be delayed until the best ancillary data is available. Use of ancillaries from different data days can result in significant difference in the daily cloud and aerosol product generated at NRT compared to the operational products from MODAPS. The L2 Fire, Snow, and Sea Ice from NRT are nearly identical to the operational product as these PGEs do not make use of ancillary data products. A special version of the L2 Land Surface Reflectance for near real-time use was developed by the Principal Investigator (PI); this code uses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Forecast System (GFS) ancillary product as opposed to Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) used in the standard processing version. Difference in L2 surface reflectance product from this change to processing code in NRT processing isn’t significant. Image MODIS Cloud top tempurature over the Midwest. Thin clouds over Lake Superior show sensitivity to GDAS ancillary data. The near real-time PGE codes were extensively science tested and all products were compared to the baseline products generated by the standard processing. This comparison was made by the atmosphere and land Quality Assessment (QA) (Land Data Operational Products Evaluation [ LDOPE ]) staff and by the PIs. All PGEs have been validated for use in LANCE-MODIS by the PIs. This process will be repeated as new versions of the PGEs become available and are considered for inclusion in LANCE-MODIS. Side by Side Comparison Two examples of side-by-side comparisons of the standard and near real-time products are shown here. The first shows a Land Surface Reflectance granule over the Midwest. There appears to be no difference between the products. However, under close examination the near real-time view shows slightly more haze West of the Great Lakes. In contrast, the second side-by-side comparison is for Cloud Top Temperature for the same granule and there are very obvious differences in the region West of the Great Lakes. This is as a result of the sensitivity of this product to the GDAS ancillary data. Back to top MOPITT NRT The MOPITT NRT Product (NRT) differs from the Standard Product (SP) in the following ways: The SP uses NASA's GMAO MERRA-2 reanalysis data to estimate the meteorological conditions, such as water vapor and temperature profiles. The NRT uses MERRA-2 forecasts. The SP uses MODIS cloud masks to filter out cloudy pixels. The NRT uses MOPITT thermal channels compared with the expected radiance from surface in order to discriminate clear from cloudy pixels. SP products are daily files, whereas NRT files are released as soon as they are processed. The granule size varies depending on the input files that are received. SP are inspected for QA to ensure consistency with validated granules. NRT files undergo automatic QA which will alert the processing team if there are any anomalies. Level 2 SP files are further processing to create daily and monthly Level 3 products. NRT files remain at Level 2. SP are regularly delivered to the ASDC for archive and distribution. NRT products are not archived and are distributed from NCAR servers. OMI NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. The quality of OMI NRT Level 2 products compares favorably to the standard products. There appears to be some variances at high latitudes with high solar zenith angles. In the following table we display the maximum differences for a single day and averaged over a week. Product Variable Daily Maximum Percentage Difference Weekly Average Maximum Percentage Difference OMTO3 Total Ozone Column 2.64% 1.40% OMCLDRR Cloud Fraction 6.02% 1.42% Cloud Pressure 2.82% 0.67% OMAERUV AOD (388 nm) 5.95% 2.31% Back to top OMPS NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. The quality of OMPS NRT Level 2 products compares favorably to the standard products. There appears to be some variances at high latitudes with high solar zenith angles. In the following table we display the maximum differences for a single day and averaged over a week. NMTO3-L2 and NPBUVO3-L2 The science team has not found any large difference in the quality of the products, a more detailed analysis will be provided in the near future. A comparison between Near Real-Time SNPP/OMPS PCA SO2 product and the Standard SNPP/OMPS PCA SO2 product In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets for the SNPP/OMPS principal component analysis (PCA) SO2 product (NMSO2-PCA-L2). In general, the near real-time (NRT) SNPP/OMPS PCA SO2 product is very similar to the standard processing product. On average, the differences between the NRT and standard SO2 products are 0.03 DU (Dobson Units) or less. Note that under most circumstances, the actual SO2 loading in the atmosphere is very small, and the percentage difference would be significant even for a very small absolute difference. There are stripes (or rows) with relative large differences between the NRT and the standard products, especially for high latitudes or the edge of the swath. This is likely due to the setup of the PCA retrieval algorithm, in which principal components (PCs) are extracted from the input radiance data for each cross-track position (row) of the each OMPS orbit. The PCs are then used in spectral fitting for all pixels in the same row. Differences in the input radiance and other input data may lead to different PCs and also different number of PCs that are actually used in the spectral fitting, resulting in relatively large differences for some rows. The table below summarizes the differences between NRT and standard SNPP/OMPS PCA SO2 products. Parameter Max Difference (DU)* Mean Difference (DU)** SO2_PBL (total column amount assuming all SO2 near the surface) 1.3 0.027 SO2_TRL (total column amount assuming 3-km SO2 plume height) 1.2 0.022 SO2_TRM (total column amount assuming 8-km SO2 plume height) 0.6 0.013 SO2_TRU (total column amount assuming 13-km SO2 plume height) 0.4 <0.01 SO2_STL (total column amount assuming 18-km SO2 plume height) 0.3 <0.01 *The maximum of the absolute difference between NRT and standard products for one day (10/09/2017). *The mean of the absolute difference between NRT and standard products for one day (10/09/2017). VIIRS Land NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. NRT processing uses session based L0 files acquired at the end of each downlink session within 10-30 minutes of real-time, delivered by the EOS Data and Operations System (EDOS), whereas standard forward processing acquires 2-hour L0 files (time based) within 7-8 hours of real-time. For geolocation NRT uses definitive orbit information similar to the operational processing. However there could be still minor difference in the geolocation due to difference in certain other ancillary products used by the geolocation processing such as polar wander files. Error introduced by use of such difference ancillaries is minor, but in some situations this position error may be large (several kilometers). In particular, the larger errors may occur after spacecraft maneuvers. Impacted time period may vary from ~30 minutes in case of lunar calibration roll maneuver to ~ 2hrs in case of an inclination maneuver. In these cases users are advised to use the standard product generated using the best available satellite position data and after the quality assurance team has reviewed and removed data degraded by spacecraft maneuver. L1B and most L2 products use the same algorithm and LUTs as used by the operational processing except for difference in some of ancillary. For example Land cloud mask processing might use NISE data from a prior data day if the data is not available for the current day processing resulting in minor difference in land cloud mask product and downstreams. Similarly there could be significant difference in retrieved LST (could be as large as 5 deg K) from use of NCEP at NRT as opposed to the MERRA2 used by the standard processing for water vapor input. For Level 3, rolling products download this PDF to explain the differences between the NRT and standard \"n-day\" products. VIIRS Atmosphere NRT In order to generate near real-time (NRT) VIIRS Atmosphere products within 3 hours of observation time, several changes have been made to the standard processing approach. These differences are outlined as follows. NRT processing utilizes session-based L0 files ingested by the Atmosphere SIPS from the EOS Data and Operations System (EDOS) available within 1 – 2 hours of real-time. Standard forward stream processing uses time-based L0 files ingested within 5 - 7 hours of real-time. For geolocation, NRT uses definitive orbit information similar to the operational processing. However, there could be still minor difference in the geolocation due to difference in ancillary products used by the geolocation processing such as polar wander files or the geolocation LUT files. Error introduced by use of such difference ancillaries is typically minor, but in some situations this position error may be large (several kilometers). Larger errors may occur after spacecraft maneuvers. Impacted time period may vary from ~30 minutes in case of lunar calibration roll maneuver to ~ 2hrs in case of an inclination maneuver. In these cases users are advised to use the standard product generated using the best available satellite position data and after the quality assurance team has reviewed and removed data degraded by spacecraft maneuver. The Standard Forward Stream Processing Mode creates the best possible global VIIRS Level 1B and Atmosphere products using the highest fidelity input data sources, including (but not limited to) retransmitted Level 0 data from EDOS; calibration lookup tables (LUTs) from offline analysis by the NASA VIIRS Characterization Support Team; and final versions of ancillary data from external providers (e.g. LAADS, UCAR, NCDC, etc.). The philosophy for these products is to wait until the best input data are available, and then create the best possible VIIRS Level 1B, VIIRS Atmosphere Level 2, and Level 3 products. The Near Real-Time Processing Mode creates low latency global VIIRS Level 1B and Atmosphere Level 2 products, within the constraints imposed by the time delay in receiving the session-based VIIRS L0 files. The philosophy for the NRT products is to provide rapid turnaround to Science Team members and other investigators who require the VIIRS Atmosphere products in near real-time. The VIIRS L1B/L2 products are created using the same or similar algorithms used to create the Standard Forward Stream Mode products, however the calibration LUTs and ancillary data available at the time the Level 0 data are received are used. For NRT production, ancillary input products (e.g. NISE) from an earlier time period, and sometime even several days prior, may be used, while standard mode operational processing may be delayed until the best ancillary data is available. For example, the VIIRS MVCM Cloud Mask NRT product uses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Forecast System (GFS) ancillary product as opposed to the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) product used in the standard processing version. The VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol NRT product utilizes the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) model forecasts instead of the reanalysis product. In addition, the Deep Blue product implements a different QA flag (QA flag Ocean = 2) for the NRT product associated with the effects of GEOS-5 wind speed on AOD retrievals over oceans in regions near sun glint.

Air Quality Satellite data have been used to track propagation of toxic gases like CO from massive fires; accurate early warnings of such pollution spikes are useful because they give people the option to reduce their risk of exposure to poor air by limiting outdoor activity at these times. Ash Plumes Satellite data are useful for identifying and tracking ash plumes from volcanic eruptions. The use of NRT satellite data for monitoring volcanic plumes is undergoing further developments to enable quantitative retrievals to be produced, which should enable a global capability for volcanic ash monitoring to be introduced. Drought Agro-climatic monitoring programs and global food security risks are monitored using NRT satellite data including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and GEOGLAM. Dust Storms Dust storms can have an impact on human health, weather patterns as well as cause disruption through flight delays and the closure of highways. Data from LANCE are used to monitor and predict dust storms. This information is used by agencies within the Department of Defense to improve resource allocation in remote areas and help promote aircraft safety. Fires Ultra Real-Time (URT), Real-Time (RT), NRT satellite data and imagery enable people on the ground, including those responsible for mobilizing fire-fighting resources around the world, detailed information about the locations of fires. URT, RT and NRT MODIS, VIIRS and Landsat active fire/hotspot data are available in easy to use formats through the Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ). Floods Mapping floodwater extent for active floods is critical for local and regional officials and for disaster relief organizations that need to ascertain where to focus their efforts. Severe Storms MODIS data are used to revise or confirm 24-hour forecasts related to weather systems approaching the land from the oceans, which in turn gives confidence for flood warnings. Satellite images are also useful in providing everyone with the same 'big picture' of severe storms. Shipping In the polar regions, NRT satellite imagery provided by LANCE are routinely, in combination with other data, are used to provide up-to-date information on sea ice conditions to ships and research vessels.

Joseph Smith Nov 9, 2022 Image NASA EOSDIS System Manager and LANCE Manager, Karen Michael. Credit: NASA ESDIS Project. NASA’s Earth Science Data and Information System ( ESDIS ) Project manages the science systems of NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System ( EOSDIS ), which provides NASA Earth science data to a wide community of users around the globe. In that capacity, the project is responsible for processing, archiving, and distributing Earth science data products, providing tools to facilitate these efforts, improving services for users, ensuring scientists and the public have access to NASA data, and promoting the interdisciplinary use of EOSDIS data to a range of existing and potential user communities. Karen Michael has been involved in this mission since 1995, and, as she put it, her career just “evolved over time.” Today, Michael is a System Manager of EOSDIS, a position in which she works to define the responsibilities of flight projects when sending their data to NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers ( DAACs ), and manager of NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ), a position in which she works to enhance LANCE's reliability, reduce data latency, and make more users aware of the availability of near real-time (NRT) data. In the following interview, Michael discusses her career path, her work with EOSDIS and LANCE, the common aim of her main roles, and how, after 27 years, she still finds ESDIS to be a project in which she can work and grow. I'd like to begin by asking about your career path. How did you come to work for ESDIS? My route to working at NASA was a little unusual. In my first job after graduation, I worked as a chemist in a materials science laboratory. While working there full time, I went back to school part time and got a degree in electrical engineering, and I became interested in robotics. While in the lab, I worked on several NASA contracts, one of which involved making superconductors. I wanted to work for NASA in robotics though, and when the opportunity arose I applied for an engineering position with the agency. I was hired as a civil servant and as there were no positions available in robotics, my first job was designing hardware for a lossless data compression algorithm (i.e., a method of data compression without the loss of information). While working in the hardware lab at NASA, I went back to school at night and got a degree in engineering management. Sometime later, a coworker who had gone to work for ESDIS announced he was leaving his job and he thought I might be interested in it, so I applied, got it, and began working in integrating and testing for ESDIS for the then upcoming TRMM mission. I really enjoyed working in the ESDIS Project and felt it was a good opportunity for me to grow. I started working with interfaces, documents, and projects and it just evolved over time. I began managing some of the tests for upcoming launches, such as for NASA’s Aqua satellite and the NASA-USGS Landsat 7 satellite. Later, when the system management position became available, I applied for that and got it. I’ve been in ESDIS for about 27 years now and I still find it an excellent project to grow in. The work keeps coming with each new mission and there’s always something new. You fulfill two major roles: EOSDIS System Manager and LANCE Manager. What does each position entail and what are your main areas of focus? As system manager, I work with the flight projects, whose data we serve through the DAACs. Basically, I’m the first person in ESDIS to interface with the flight projects and help define what their roles and responsibilities are for providing data to the DAACs. I also manage NASA’s LANCE, which is our near real-time data system. In most cases, the flight projects are generating standard (or high-level, science-quality) products, which go to the DAACs. The LANCE is a distributed system that produces near real-time products, which are available prior to the standard products and are not archived. In fact, we want users to take the standard products when they’re available. So, the application of LANCE data is much different. In regard to your role as EOSDIS System Manager, what is the most difficult aspect of coordinating configuration management on a project like ESDIS? Configuration management (CM) is very important. CM is how we manage changes to requirements, design, and interfaces in order to maintain integrity. Creating and reviewing documents, however, is not something that scientists and engineers generally like to do, so getting them to do it in a timely manner is probably the biggest challenge. In addition, ESDIS is a big project with a long history, so another challenge is just the sheer number of documents we have and the number of accounts we have to manage. Just to give you some idea, I looked into NASA's Configuration Management EOSDIS Tool (COMET) yesterday, which is our content management system, and found that we have close to 200 documents under configuration management. We also have more than 500 users of the system, and looking back to historical documents, we have close to 1,500 that were under CM. What are the critical steps when coordinating a NASA mission and parts of the EOSDIS data systems, for example the DAACs? Data from these missions are archived by the DAACs and the selection of which discipline-specific DAAC will archive the data is usually based on the mission’s scientific goals. So, I work with the flight projects to help them understand what their roles and responsibilities are for providing data to the DAACs, and then we get into the interface control document, which defines the protocol and the details of the data exchange. Standardizing the interfaces is really key to keeping the cost and complexity down, so what we try to do is maintain very similar interfaces. We have the DAACs standardized in the way that they ingest and archive and distribute, and in the same manner, the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), which is our imagery browsing system has a standard type of interface. The way that metadata, which are what make data searchable and allow for the efficient management of large data collections, is provided is also very standardized. Switching gears now to your work as LANCE Manager, what would you say is LANCE's most important objective? Is it making more NRT data available? Reducing latency? System reliability? Or perhaps making more users aware that NRT data are available to them? I think all those things are important, but if I had to pick one, it would be reducing latency, because that’s the main reason LANCE exists and has become so popular. The data from LANCE has really enabled NASA Worldview and NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ), which provides near real-time active fire data to the wildland fire community, to provide imagery in a timely manner to decision-makers all over the world. Worldview and FIRMS are among the top NASA sites visited every day, and for good reason. I think users really like the responsiveness of the low latency data. When you get on Worldview that’s the first thing you see—the imagery that’s just been collected—and the beauty of it is that you don’t need to be a scientist to use Worldview and FIRMS. Can you explain what makes LANCE data different from the standard products archived at the DAACs? Standard products are stored at the DAACs and they’re for scientific research and the long-term climate record. LANCE NRT products are used for short-term weather prediction or by people like wildland firefighters and first responders to hazards and disasters who don’t have time to wait for standard products to be processed. It’s the timeliness of the data that they need. But producing products quicker means they’re not as good as the standard products, and so things like the geolocation may be slightly off, because we’re using things like predicted ephemeris (i.e., data that provide the assigned places of a celestial body or human-made satellite at regular intervals) and not waiting for ancillary data that’s also used in standard processing. In a lot of cases, standard processing involves waiting for other sources of data to come in and be available before the processing can start, whereas with LANCE we bypass that step. [Note: Read an in-depth explanation of NRT versus standard products .] What do you see for the future of NRT data and LANCE? For a while, near real-time or low latency data wasn’t given much attention at NASA, but it’s starting to be something that future missions are looking at. Maybe it’s not their first objective, but as a second objective. Managing LANCE is something that’s near and dear to my heart. I’ve been with it since its inception and I’ve seen the impact that it’s had. I really hope to see LANCE continue to grow in the future. I think it’s going to be a bit more challenging in that some of the upcoming missions really don’t have NRT requirements. Getting those requests in later is always harder, that’s the lesson we’ve learned from the past, but we’re still seeing it happen because science objectives are what drive missions and standard products are usually the first priority. I have been involved in latency studies for some upcoming missions and they are considering some NRT applications so I’m hoping to see LANCE continue to evolve. Does NASA keep statistics about how many people accessing NRT data each day? We do collect those metrics. We collect a lot of metrics about the data we distribute and who we distribute it to. For LANCE there are close to 300 image and data products being distributed at a volume of 40-75 Terabytes per week to users in more than 200 countries. We also track our latency to make sure we’re staying below the three hours or less benchmark for LANCE. How do user requests come to you? Do they come to you through the LANCE User Working Group or are there other mechanisms for that? We have two primary mechanisms for that. One is a survey that we conduct about every two years that goes out to LANCE users and the community. It asks these kinds of questions: What data do they use? How do they use it? and What would they like to see provided in the future? We also receive requests through the LANCE User Working Group ( UWG ), and we take requests from any user who has an application that’s not being filled or who has an idea. They fill out a LANCE enhancement request and we review it and figure out if and how it can be implemented and what it would cost to do it. Then we go back to the ESDIS Project and see if we have the funding. If we don’t, we go to [NASA] Headquarters and request funding. If headquarters approves it, then we go forward. That’s how we’ve been operating in LANCE. It’s a little different from the rest of EOSDIS, because LANCE itself doesn’t really have a budget that allows me to say, this is what we’re going to do this year or next year. It’s based on requests from users and the community. How frequently do you receive such requests and are they for products that are attainable? Our UWG meets twice a year, so it could be two times per year. Sometimes we don’t get any requests in the spring and we get three requests in the fall, so maybe on the order of one or two a year. Typically, it’s been requests for something we have a standard product for, but someone wants it in NRT. Basically, it’s the same standard algorithm, but with modifications required to make it run in NRT. Every once in a while, it might be another source of data that we haven’t collected before. So now, for example, in FIRMS we’re getting direct readout data. It may be the same data that we’re bringing down normally, but in this case we’re getting it even faster, so the request is made for more timely data, such as less than an hour instead of three hours. So, given the purview of your two roles, is it fair to say they’re both focused on ensuring users have access to the data they need? Yes, I would say that for sure. We’re serving users. That’s what we’re here to do and I think that’s common to both the standard products and the NRT products available through LANCE. We’re always listening to what users need and trying to improve on what we provide in regard to the formats users want the data to be in, providing the requested imagery, making it easier to access and use NASA Earth science data, and so on.

Read more about LANCE and the system architecture . User Community LANCE users span a variety of communities interested in a range of applications. Users come from both the civilian and military sectors, from government and non-government agencies, and from universities and other research intuitions. This section highlights a selection of LANCE users. Fire Global Fire Information Management System (GFIMS)—GFIMS is an operational version of the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) running at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO ), where it complements the FAO’s existing suite of projects charged with delivering near real-time information to ongoing monitoring and emergency projects to other UN organizations as well as providing information to the general public. Global Observation of Forest and Land Cover Dynamics ( GOFC-GOLD )—The GOFC/GOLD-Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme is a project of the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) program and is aimed at refining and articulating the international observation requirements and making the best possible use of fire products from existing and future satellite observing systems for fire management, policy decision-making, and global change research. The UN Global Fire Monitoring Center also provides Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS )-based fire data for the international fire community. Advanced Fire Information System ( AFIS )—AFIS is a comprehensive wildfire information system that provides users with information and intelligence around the prediction, detection, monitoring, and assessment of wildfires globally. Earth observing satellite wildfire detections are complemented with both crowdsource detections from the AFIS Watchtower app as well as through automated in situ camera detection systems capable of detecting thin smoke plumes up to 20 miles away. Fire Danger models such as the Canadian Fire Weather Index ( FWI ) and Australian McArthur Fire Danger models have been fully integrated in to the system and can be produced for any area globally. A new MODIS burned area product has been produced by merging the standard MCD45 MODIS with the MCD64 Burned Area product, while a new Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 algorithm has also been developed to provide higher resolution mapping of new fire events. AFIS provides a hybrid wildfire dashboard providing situational awareness for any region of interest and integrates NASA Worldview into the dashboard to improve the visualization component within the dashboard and provides users with access to not only the Direct Readout station data, but also all NASA Global Imagery Browse Services ( GIBS ) datasets. Floods NRT Global MODIS Flood Mapping —NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Office of Applied Science ( OAS ) is working to operationalize near real-time global flood mapping using NRT MODIS data provided through LANCE. This work builds on the long-time expertise and efforts of the Dartmouth Flood Observatory ( DFO ) to map floodwater extent in detail for active floods. DFO provides additional detail, additional products, and archives of historical flood maps. The maps generated are available to governments and relief organizations. DFO also compiles yearly catalogs, maps, and images of river floods from 1985 to the present, primarily for researchers. Agriculture The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service ( USDA FAS ) uses NRT MODIS imagery from LANCE to observe large areas across the world. These images help FAS improve the accuracy and timeliness of crop yield predictions, which are needed to make decisions affecting U.S. agriculture, trade policy, and food aid. MODIS collects data twice daily: from the Terra satellite in the morning and the Aqua satellite in the afternoon. This helps analysts observe how events such as fires, volcanic eruptions, floods, storms, or extreme temperatures affect crops. Global Agricultural Monitoring ( GLAM ), a collaborative project between the University of Maryland, USDA FAS, and NASA, uses NRT MODIS data to produce crop masks and timely NDVI products that allow FAS analysts to distinguish between different crops like wheat and rice and predict yield by comparing current data with previous years. Air Quality The United States Air Force Weather Agency and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory ( NRL ) rely on MODIS NRT images to monitor and predict dust storms in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. Dust storms can interfere with troop and equipment movement and with aircraft safety. The military also uses NRT imagery for other areas in the world where weather conditions, snow cover, smoke, fires, volcanic eruptions, and other things could impact military operations.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the U.S. NRL monitor for smoke that might be a health threat. Aerosol Robotic Network ( AERONET )—AERONET is a worldwide network of ground based sensors that monitor the air for aerosols to understand the impact of aerosols on climate change. LANCE provides NRT MODIS imagery of the sensor sites. By comparing satellite and ground-based observations, scientists can learn how aerosols reflect and absorb light and can validate satellite-based aerosol observations. This will improve the tools scientists use to monitor aerosols over the entire Earth. Sea Ice The British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) uses MODIS NRT imagery to help navigate sea ice and to populate Polar View , a website that delivers information about sea ice extent and icebergs directly to ships operating in the Southern Ocean. Users of Polar View in the Antarctic include national program operators, tourist vessels, and other ships working in this region. The aim of Polar View is to make sea ice information widely accessible to all ships and operators in the Southern Ocean. The Polar Geospatial Center ( PGC ) uses NRT MODIS imagery to flag significant polar events, this information is used to task higher resolution imagery. PGC also harvests MODIS NRT imagery to add to its collection of satellite imagery supporting researchers and logistics groups in the polar science community. Timely data are used to support the U.S. Antarctic Program ( USAP ). The images are used to plot new courses for the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker, fuel, and cargo ships bringing supplies to McMurdo Station , the American research station on Antarctica. Daily images are crucial to chart a safe course around the drifting icebergs and through the sea ice that covers McMurdo Sound. The images are also being used by scientists who are tracking the movement of icebergs. Outreach As LANCE can create an image of an event such as a major fire the same day it happens, the images are ideal for news and outreach. LANCE provides regular images of storms, fires, and other events as they happen to NASA's Public Affairs Office and the media. MODIS NRT images have been featured in major newspaper and television networks across the world. NASA’s Earth Observatory website posts regular MODIS images of significant events around the world in the Natural Hazards section and in their Image of the Day feature. MODIS NRT images have also appeared on NASA's web portal , Goddard home page, and on Goddard TV . The American Museum of Natural History ( AMNH ) incorporates MODIS NRT images into a regularly updated exhibit about Earth called Science Bulletins . Displayed on interactive kiosks and on high-definition video, the Science Bulletins provide a way for museums to exhibit stories and information about current science, and are intended to show that science is dynamic with new discoveries being made constantly. There are four Science Bulletins: Astro Bulletin , which is about astrophysics and astronomy; Bio Bulletin , about biodiversity and conservation; Earth Bulletin , about Earth and climate; and Human Bulletin , about human interactions with the environment. In addition to being displayed at the American Museum of Natural History, the Bulletins are also made available for display to other science museums, universities, and NASA visitor centers around the U.S. and Canada. Currently, 21 institutions are participating. The Bulletin sites offer additional information not available in the exhibits as well as an archive of past Bulletins. Back to top User Working Group LANCE is reviewed and supported by a User Working Group (UWG) whose members reflect the various user communities served by LANCE. The group is chaired by Miguel Román, Senior Director and Chief Scientist of Climate and Environment at Leidos. Román has taken over from Professor Chris Justice (Chair of the Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland) who was chair for 10 years. The UWG meets at least once per year to review the status of LANCE operations and development activities and to provide guidance concerning future upgrades suggested by the user communities and the LANCE elements. Details of the responsibilities of the UWG are given in the UWG Charter. More information about the User Working Group can be found on the LANCE wiki .

In that context, the land science of VIIRS will build and expand on the heritage of land science from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and EOS MODIS. The strength of these systems lies in their time-series of daily multi-spectral observations, which are used to characterize and monitor the land surface at regional to global scales. MODIS provided a new standard in calibrated, science-quality, coarse-resolution satellite observations that will continue with VIIRS. VIIRS data will be used to expand upon the MODIS applications to fire and air quality monitoring, agriculture monitoring and production modeling, carbon modeling, and flood and sea ice mapping. VIIRS Corrected Reflectance Imagery The VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery is only produced in near real-time. It provides continuity from the MODIS Corrected Reflectance imagery that was developed to provide natural-looking images by removing gross atmospheric effects such as Rayleigh scattering from the visible bands. By contrast, the Surface Reflectance product is available in near real-time and as a standard product. Surface Reflectance provides a more complete atmospheric correction algorithm that includes aerosol correction and is designed to derive land surface properties. In clear atmospheric conditions the corrected reflectance product is similar to the SR product, but they depart from each other in the presence of aerosols. Band Combinations VIIRS (Suomi NPP/NOAA-20) Corrected Reflectance True Color True Color: Red = Band I1 (600-680 nm), Green = Band M4 (545-565 nm), Blue = Band M3 (478-498 nm) These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic, and atmospheric features. The VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as NRT imagery. The imagery can be visualized in NASA's Worldview and Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). The sensor resolution is 750m and 375m (M Bands are 750m, I Bands are 375m), imagery resolution is 250m, temporal resolution is daily, and temporal availability for viewing in GIBS/Worldview is November 24, 2015, to present. View True Color (I1, M4, M3) in Worldview . VIIRS (Suomi NPP/NOAA-20) Corrected Reflectance (Bands M3, I3, M11) False Color: Red = M3 (478-498 nm), Green = I3 (1580-1640 nm), Blue = M11 (2225-2275 nm) This combination is used to map snow and ice. Snow and ice are very reflective in the visible part of the spectrum (Band M3), and very absorbent in Bands I3 and M11 (short-wave infrared, or SWIR). This band combination is good for distinguishing liquid water from frozen water, for example, clouds over snow, ice cloud versus water cloud; or floods from dense vegetation. This layer is similar to the MODIS Corrected Reflectance Bands 3, 6, 7 layer. The VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as NRT imagery. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview and GIBS . The sensor resolution is 750m and 375m (M Bands are 750m, I Bands are 375m), imagery resolution is 250m, temporal resolution is daily, and temporal availability for viewing in GIBS/Worldview is November 24, 2015, to present. View False Color (M3, I3, M11) in Worldview . Snow and Ice Since the only visible light used in these images (Band M3) is assigned to red, snow and ice appear bright red. The more ice, the stronger the absorption in the SWIR bands, and the more red the color. Thick ice and snow appear vivid red (or dark pink), while small ice crystals in high-level clouds will appear pinkish. Vegetation Vegetation will appear green in this band combination, as vegetation is absorbent in Bands M3 and M11, but reflective in Band I3. Bare soil and deserts will appear bright cyan in the image since it is much more reflective in Band I3 and M11 than Band M3. Water Liquid water on the ground will appear very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR, but small liquid water drops in clouds scatter light equally in both the visible and the SWIR, and will therefore appear white. Sediments in water appear dark red. VIIRS (Suomi NPP/NOAA-20) Corrected Reflectance (Bands M11, I2, I1) False Color: Red = M11 (2225-2275 nm), Green = I2 (846-885 nm), Blue = I1 (600-680 nm) This combination is most useful for distinguishing burn scars from naturally low vegetation or bare soil and enhancing floods. This combination can also be used to distinguish snow and ice from clouds. Snow and ice are very reflective in the visible part of the spectrum (Band I1), and absorbent in Bands I2 (near infrared) and M11 (short-wave infrared, or SWIR). Thick ice and snow appear vivid sky blue, while small ice crystals in high-level clouds will also appear blueish, and water clouds will appear white. This layer is similar to the MODIS Corrected Reflectance Bands 7, 2, 1 layer. VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as NRT imagery. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview , Worldview Snapshots , and GIBS . The sensor resolution is 750m and 375m (M Bands are 750m, I Bands are 375m), imagery resolution is 250m, temporal resolution is daily, and temporal availability for viewing in GIBS/Worldview is November 24, 2015, to present. View False Color (M11, I2, I1) in Worldview . Vegetation and bare ground Vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared (Band I2), and absorbent in Band I1 and Band M11. Assigning that band to green means even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Naturally bare soil, like a desert, is reflective in all bands used in this image, but more so in the SWIR (Band M11, red) and so soils will often have a pinkish tinge. Burned areas Burned areas or fire-affected areas are characterized by deposits of charcoal and ash, removal of vegetation, and the alteration of vegetation structure. When bare soil becomes exposed, the brightness in Band I1 may increase, but that may be offset by the presence of black carbon residue; the near infrared (Band I2) will become darker, and Band M11 becomes more reflective. When assigned to red in the image, Band M11 will show burn scars as deep or bright red, depending on the type of vegetation burned, the amount of residue, or the completeness of the burn. Water Liquid water on the ground appears very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR. Sediments in water appear dark blue. Ice and snow appear as bright turquoise. Clouds comprised of small water droplets scatter light equally in both the visible and the SWIR and will appear white. These clouds are usually lower to the ground and warmer. High and cold clouds are comprised of ice crystals and will appear turquoise.

AMSR2 NRT Data Outages and Known Issues Known Issue: NRT AMSR2 Daily L3 Global Snow Water Equivalent EASE-Grids JAXA's NRT L1R brightness temperature data are supplied to us in \"nearly-orbit\" files. Unlike the standard products, the data in these files usually doesn't start or end exactly at the north pole. We process these data in the form in which we receive them by splitting them into descending and ascending \"half-orbit\" files at the south pole inflection point. Therefore, there may be extra or missing data at the beginning of the descending half-orbit and at the end of the ascending half-orbit. Improved latency for the near real time L1R data means that AMSR2 LANCE products are consistently available within the target time period of three hours from observation. However, because the AMSR2 snow product is generated only from the descending passes, when data are missing at the beginning of the descending half-orbit, that data will be missing from the resulting snow product and corresponding imagery as well.
