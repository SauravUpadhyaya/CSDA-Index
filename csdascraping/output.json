These commercial smallsat data may provide a cost-effective way to augment or complement the suite of Earth observations acquired by NASA, other U.S. Government agencies, and international partners. ESD recognizes the potential impact commercial small-satellite (smallsat) constellations may have in encouraging/enabling efficient approaches to advancing Earth System Science and applications development for societal benefit. The CSDA Program was initiated in 2017 with the Private-Sector Small Constellation Satellite Data Product Pilot Project . Strategic Objectives NASA’s ESD will continuously monitor the commercial smallsat industry and acquire relevant data to complement NASA's Earth observation data. Data that are favorably evaluated and deemed of sufficient value will be purchased by NASA for broader sustained use. To facilitate standard scientific collaborations, NASA will seek end-user license agreements (EULAs) to enable broad levels of dissemination and shareability of the commercial data with U.S. Government agencies and partners. NASA will maintain an archive of the data acquired from the vendors. Establish continuous and repeatable processes to on-ramp new commercial data vendors and evaluate data for their potential to advance NASA’s Earth science research and applications activities. Ensure long-term data preservation through the establishment of data management processes and systems to support rapid evaluation, access, and distribution of purchased data and long-term access for scientific reproducibility. Enable the sustained use of purchased data for broader use and dissemination by the Earth scientific community. Coordinate with other U.S. Government agencies and international partners on the evaluation and scientific use of commercial data. The scientific community may use commercial datasets that are acquired by NASA for scientific purposes in adherence to vendor-specific terms and conditions. All data requests must be approved by CSDA via submitting the authorization request form . Once verified, the user will be provided with additional information on how to request and access data. Current information about vendors, user licenses, and available data can be found in the vendor section below. As additional commercial small satellite datasets are evaluated and acquired, those datasets will also be made available.

Credit: DEM(s) created by the Polar Geospatial Center from Maxar imagery Vendor On-ramp and Evaluation NASA’s ESD has established a formal process for identifying commercial smallsat vendors for on-ramp and evaluation. This process involves Request For Proposals (RFPs) followed by an independent NASA evaluation of selected commercial data products. As necessary, NASA ESD will perform market research to assess the development of Earth science commercial data products and market growth across the industry. If warranted, RFPs will be issued to on-ramp additional vendors as the industry emerges with new candidates and capabilities. Vendors meeting the minimum qualifications could submit a RFP so that NASA can evaluate the data to determine their suitability for advancing NASA’s science and application goals. All RFPs and contracts contain standardized scientific use EULAs to avoid confusion for users about how the data can be used. The CSDA Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) was posted September 27, 2022. Evaluation Data products from selected vendors are evaluated by teams of principal investigators (PIs) selected by the ESD. Evaluation criteria include: Accessibility of data Completeness and accuracy of metadata User support services provided by the commercial entity Usefulness of submitted data for science and applications The evaluation results are summarized and distributed to ESD senior management. NASA uses the summary evaluation report, individual PI reports, and other information to determine the suitability of data from each vendor for future procurement. More details on the data evaluations are available on the Smallsat Data Evaluation page. All data purchased during the evaluation phase are preserved for long-term use by the scientific community in accordance with the EULA. Ongoing CSDA Program Activities CSDA continually reaches out to the scientific community via science meetings, workshops, and conference presentations to increase interest in the program and learn how researchers are using the commercial data. Read publications by NASA-funded researchers to see how CSDA-acquired commercial Earth science data are being used.

Find Data Earth’s atmosphere is a thin veil of gas surrounding the planet. Although it only extends a few hundred kilometers above the surface, it contains a mixture of gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen, that are critical for life to exist. It distributes incoming solar radiation, protecting life from harmful ultraviolet radiation but also driving atmospheric circulation and weather. The atmosphere enables the greenhouse effect, which makes Earth more habitable. Human activity, however, is contributing more gases, many of which are negatively impacting the protective nature of this vital layer. NASA data provide measurements on weather phenomena as well as gases within the troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) and stratosphere (the layer above the troposphere) and their effect on air quality. Data products include information about geophysical processes involving clouds, aerosols, precipitation, lightning, chemistry, temperature, radiation balance, and dynamics. Interactions of the atmosphere with land and ocean surfaces along with measurements of solar radiation also fall within this discipline.

It is critical for maintaining species diversity, regulating climate, and providing numerous ecosystem functions. Find Data The biosphere is made up of the parts of Earth where life exists. It extends from the deep ocean floor, to lush rainforests, and high mountaintops. This important sphere supports almost every aspect of human well-being and distinguishes Earth from other planets in our solar system. NASA data have changed the way we study life on Earth. Remote sensing and field-based data from NASA and partner federal agencies provide opportunities for biological and ecological research and applications. They have been used to assess the health of forests, detect tree cover loss, and prevent the spread of invasive species. Data on vegetation health, primary productivity, evapotranspiration, forest structure, and ocean chlorophyll provide insight into the health and productivity of the biosphere. NASA data can also can be used to study the suitability of an environment for different species as well as species distribution within a habitat.

Mar 23, 2023 Dr. Owen Cooper, Senior Research Scientist, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder/NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory Image Dr. Owen Cooper, Senior Research Scientist, CIRES, University of Colorado Boulder/NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory. Cooper is also a member of NASA's ASDC User Working Group. Credit: CIRES. Research Interests: The regional and intercontinental transport of atmospheric trace gases and particulate matter; trends in U.S. and global air quality; the global tropospheric ozone budget; and the stratosphere-troposphere exchange processes. Research Highlights: Of all the chemical compounds found in Earth’s atmosphere, ozone (O 3 ) is something of a two-edged sword. In the stratosphere (the layer of the atmosphere 10 to 40 kilometers above the surface) ozone acts as a shield to protect life on Earth, including humanity, from the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. A weakening of this shield would make humans more susceptible to skin cancer, cataracts, and impaired immune systems. However, in the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere from the surface up to about 12 kilometers) ozone is a harmful pollutant that can damage lung tissues when inhaled and harm the cell membranes of plants. Further, when it resides at the top of the troposphere, ozone can act as a greenhouse gas by trapping heat in the atmosphere, thereby contributing to global warming. The natural concentration of ozone at the surface is about 10–20 parts per billion (i.e., 10 molecules of ozone for every billion molecules of air). However, the levels of tropospheric ozone can rise when pollutants such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) gases from vehicle and industrial emissions react in the presence of sunlight. Given ozone’s potential to be a harmful pollutant and greenhouse gas, atmospheric scientists around the globe are keen to monitor its levels in the troposphere. “It’s generally gone up over the past 150 years or so,” said Dr. Owen Cooper, Senior Research Scientist with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences ( CIRES ) at the University of Colorado Boulder and the NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory . “Down near the surface, on the local and regional scale, we also want to know if air quality is improving or getting worse. In places like the Eastern United States, due to effective emissions controls, ozone has really come down. But in the developing world and in places like China and India, it’s getting worse as their emissions go up.” Cooper would know. Since 2014, he’s led the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report ( TOAR ), an international effort initiated by the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry ( IGAC ) Project to provide the global atmospheric research community with up-to-date scientific assessments of the trends and global distribution of tropospheric ozone from the surface to the tropopause, the atmospheric boundary separating the troposphere from the stratosphere. “TOAR is an international effort to understand how much ozone is in the troposphere and whether or not it’s increasing or decreasing,” said Cooper. “It’s complicated because ozone is very reactive. It’s not like carbon dioxide, which more or less does the same thing everywhere. Ozone has a short lifetime and is difficult to track. So, it takes efforts from dozens, even hundreds of scientists from around the world to do that.” The first phase of TOAR ended in 2019, so Cooper and his colleagues are now in the second phase, which will conclude in 2024. At that time, the research team will provide updates on the tropospheric ozone concentrations around the globe, just as it did at the conclusion of phase 1. (Note: TOAR’s reports can be found on the initiative’s website linked above.) Image Miles above the surface of Earth, a thin layer of ozone acts as a shield that protects us from harmful ultraviolet light. Credit: NASA. “Ozone never stops. It’s always changing. So, the plan is to give updates on ozone every 5 or 6 years,” said Cooper. “In the United States, ozone at the surface is plummeting. The air is cleaning up because of emissions controls; as our automobile fleet continues to transition to electric, we expect ozone to continue to decrease.” Cooper and his colleagues expect to see the same decreases in Europe, but not in South and East Asia. “Right now, the ozone in [South and East Asia] keeps going up. At some point, especially if they transition rapidly to renewable energy, we should see ozone come down in those regions, so we’re keeping an eye on that,” he said. To do that, Cooper and his fellow researchers use a variety of airborne, in situ, and satellite data from NASA’s Atmospheric Science Data Center ( ASDC ) and other sources. Located at NASA'S Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, the ASDC manages, archives, and distributes NASA Earth science data related to radiation budget, clouds, aerosols, and tropospheric composition, and provides tools and applications for working with these data. These data are important for understanding the causes and processes of global climate change and the consequences of human activities on Earth’s atmosphere and climate. “We use ozone observations from [the ASDC] archive of research aircraft missions going back to the 1990s (e.g., the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM) West, PEM Tropics, TRACE-P, and so on) that looked at air pollution in remote regions of the world,” said Cooper. “We’ve used those data to sort of build up a 30-year record of ozone changes based on actual observations.” Cooper and his colleagues then combine these data with other datasets, including airborne data from the Alpha Jet Atmospheric Experiment ( AJAX ) based at NASA’s Ames Research Center ( AMES ), which provides data that are crucial for assessing the amount of ozone flowing into California from across the Pacific Ocean; ground-based data from the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar instrument at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s ( JPL ) Table Mountain Facility (TMF) near Los Angeles, which measures ozone in both the troposphere and the stratosphere; data collected by ozonesondes carried by weather balloons launched by NASA, NOAA, and Environment Canada; and space-based observations, such as measurements of ozone’s global distribution acquired by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument ( OMI ) aboard NASA’s Aura satellite. “Basically, what we’ve been doing for the past 10 years is compiling all the ozone observations we can get our hands on across Western North America to try and understand how much ozone is flowing in from across the Pacific Ocean,” Cooper said. “In particular, we want to know how much impact Asia is having on the ozone levels in Western North America.” Recently, Cooper and his TOAR colleagues have been sharing their research findings in a series of papers, the first of which appeared in the journal Elementa in 2018. In that publication, lead author Dr. Audrey Gaudel of CIRES and NOAA’s Earth Systems Laboratory along with Cooper and others provided evidence that “ozone in the 21st century is greater than during the 1970s and 1980s.” At the same time, the researchers also noted that, while some remote sites and many sites in the heavily polluted regions of East Asia show ozone increases since 2000, others showed decreases and there was no discernible pattern for changes in surface ozone concentrations since 2000. Image A photo of the atmospheric scientists who took part in the first TOAR workshop held in Madrid, Spain, in April 2015. Image courtesy of Dr. Cooper. “The [paper] published in 2018 was from the TOAR report [and it] basically summarized everything we know about the present-day global distribution and trends of ozone with a focus on its impact on climate change,” Cooper said. “We were able to show with many years of satellite data that ozone had increased since the 1970s, but at the time, we weren’t really sure if ozone was continuing to increase. We didn’t have enough data.” Cooper and his TOAR colleagues eventually obtained the data they needed from the In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System ( IAGOS ) database, which contains ozone observations from more than 60,000 commercial aircraft flights worldwide. Using these data, they were able to analyze ozone trends above 11 regions—Germany, the Gulf of Guinea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Northeast China/Korea, the Northeastern United States, the Persian Gulf, South America, Southeast Asia, and Western North America—from 1994 to 2016. From this dataset, and through comparisons with observations from OMI and the Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS ), another instrument aboard the Aura satellite, Cooper and his fellow researchers were able to show that ozone had increased throughout the Northern Hemisphere from 1994 through 2016. “During the past 22 years, median ozone values have increased in the free troposphere above all 11 study regions,” the researchers write in a 2020 paper published in Science Advances. “The largest tropospheric column ozone (TCO) increases occurred above Malaysia/Indonesia, Southeast Asia, and India, followed by Northeast China/Korea and the Persian Gulf. With the exception of Northeast China/Korea, TCO increases above the midlatitude regions (North America and Europe) are much less.” These findings are significant, said Cooper, because they confirm increases in tropospheric ozone concentrations and its radiative forcing (i.e., the change in the flow of energy in the atmosphere caused by natural or anthropogenic factors of climate change) in all 11 study regions. They also suggest that increases in NOx emissions across Southern, Southeastern, and Eastern Asia are impacting tropospheric ozone levels in Western North America. Yet, while the amount of ozone in the troposphere has generally increased over the past century and a half, that increase hasn’t always been constant. For example, as Cooper and his colleagues documented in a 2022 study appearing in AGU Advances , a drop in tropospheric ozone concentrations occurred above Western North America and Europe in 2020, during the height of the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In that paper, lead author Dr. Kai-Lan Chang of CIRES and NOAA’s Earth Systems Laboratory, Cooper, and others investigated ozone trends and anomalies in the free troposphere using a new regional scale method for merging separate ozone time series. That method incorporated data from ozonesondes, JPL’s TMF Tropospheric Ozone Lidar, and the IAGOS database. To test it, the researchers focused on anomalies during the full 12 months of 2020. The researchers reported an increase in ozone concentrations above Western North America and Europe from 1994 until 2019 and then an abrupt drop in ozone in 2020, which they attributed to the economic slowdown that occurred during the pandemic. “We found that the positive 1994–2019 ozone trends above Europe and Western North America are diminished when including the large negative anomalies in 2020,” the researchers conclude in their paper. “2020 is the only year in which both regions show coincident and profound negative anomalies since the benchmark year of 1994.” Given the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, Cooper and his colleagues said it is too early to tell if emissions over Europe and Western North America would return to their pre-COVID levels. To find out, they suggested that “continuous monitoring of free tropospheric ozone in 2021 and beyond” would be required to evaluate the impact of 2020 on long-term ozone trends. Image These maps (click link for larger image) show trends of daytime average ozone from 2000 to 2014 at 1,375 non-urban sites in December, January, and February (top image) and at 1,784 non-urban sites in June, July, and August (bottom image). The number of available sites is greater in June, July, and August because most U.S. sites only operate in the warm season. Colored vector arrows indicate the probability (p-value) that a particular statistical measure will be greater than (orange arrows), less than (blue arrows), or equal to (green arrows) observed values for each site. Credit: Dr. Cooper. Of course, Cooper and his colleagues in the TOAR initiative plan to continue doing just that, for in his words, “exciting things are happening” in the United States and Europe, and he’s eager to see when South and East Asia “are going to turn a corner.” And then there’s Africa, which Cooper refers to as “a big unknown.” “[Africa] has a large and growing population, [its] energy consumption is going up, they’re using more and more fossil fuels, and we don’t have a lot of measurements from Africa. So that’s the big question mark,” he said. “The tropics are important because that’s where most of the world’s population is, there’s a lot of sunlight, and if you increase emissions in the tropics, you can make a lot of ozone, which then leaves the tropics and pollutes the rest of the world.” It might seem like ozone-measuring instruments on the satellites operated by NASA and its partner agencies could provide those measurements, but according to Cooper, they aren’t receptive enough. “Satellites fill a lot of the gaps, but they aren’t sensitive at the surface,” he said. “They can tell you how much ozone is in a full column of the atmosphere, but if you want to know what’s happening at the surface, they don’t have the necessary sensitivity.” At least not right now. The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution ( TEMPO ) instrument, which is scheduled to launch into space aboard the Intelsat 40e commercial satellite in April 2023, is expected to change that. “TEMPO will be a game changer because it will have sensitivity in the lower troposphere. Not right at the surface, but definitely more sensitivity than all the other satellite products out there,” Cooper said. “That’s going to fill in a lot of the gaps near the surface. Then we can take those data from the instrument and ingest them into air quality forecast models to improve the forecasts of air quality and air pollution events.” When data from TEMPO are available, NASA's ASDC will be there to archive and distribute them to researchers like Cooper and his colleagues who are working to monitor levels of ozone in the troposphere and track its movements around the globe.

It distributes incoming solar radiation, protecting life from harmful ultraviolet radiation but also driving atmospheric circulation and weather. The atmosphere enables the greenhouse effect, which makes Earth more habitable. Human activity, however, is contributing more gases, many of which are negatively impacting the protective nature of this vital layer. NASA data provide measurements on weather phenomena as well as gases within the troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) and stratosphere (the layer above the troposphere) and their effect on air quality. Data products include information about geophysical processes involving clouds, aerosols, precipitation, lightning, chemistry, temperature, radiation balance, and dynamics. Interactions of the atmosphere with land and ocean surfaces along with measurements of solar radiation also fall within this discipline.

Please visit the Earthdata Forum . Where can I get a highly detailed (high resolution) satellite image of my house, a street, a building, etc.? NASA Earth science data are not of a sufficient resolution for viewing individual properties or similarly-sized features. Landsat data, for example, are mostly 30m/pixel, meaning that an average house is only a couple pixels wide. However, there are a variety of commercial satellite data providers available for purchasing high resolution satellite images. I would like to use an image or data from NASA. How do I cite/acknowledge your data? Please consult the Data Citations and Acknowledgements page for more information. Are there any restrictions to using NASA Earth science data? Please consult the EOSDIS Data Use Policy page for more information. We have several other FAQs depending on the subject.

Combined (Terra and Aqua) MODIS NRT active fire products ( MCD14DL ) are processed using the standard MOD14/MYD14 Fire and Thermal Anomalies algorithm . MODIS Collection 61 has been available since April 2021. C61 processing does not contain any change to the science algorithm; the update is from changes and enhancements to the calibration approach used in the generation of the Terra and Aqua MODIS Level 1B products. For further details on C61 calibration changes and other changes user is encouraged to refer to the Collection 6.1 specific changes that have been summarized here: https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/QA_WWW/forPage/MODIS_C61_Land_Proposed_ Changes.pdf . For the most up to date information, please refer to the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User's Guide Revision B . VIIRS (375m) Active Fire Products Each VIIRS active fire/thermal hotspot location represents the center of a 375m pixel. The VIIRS data complement the MODIS fire detections but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response of fires over relatively small areas and has improved nighttime performance. Read more on VIIRS Active Fire products . VIIRS NRT 375 m active fire products are from: Suomi NPP ( VNP14IMGTDL_NRT ) and NOAA-20, formally known as JPSS-1, ( VJ114IMGTDL_NRT ). Please note, in an effort to standardize VIIRS file names from Suomi NPP, the short name for VIIRS NRT 375 m product was changed from VNP14IMGT to VNP14IMGTDL_NRT (18 April 2016). Please note: MODIS and VIIRS active fire/thermal anomaly data may be from fire, hot smoke, agriculture, or other sources.

Checkbox for interst in Meris or Sentinel Data. Yes, I'm interested in Meris and ESA Sentinel-3 Data. MERIS End User License Agreement General Conditions for the Utilization of ESA’s EO data I. Definitions ESA / “the Agency” means the European Space Agency. The PI (Principal Investigator) means the duly empowered representative of the entity having registered for the use of data within his/her project and accepted the Terms and Conditions. Project means the proposed and ESA-accepted use of data by the PI. The ESA Earth Observation data (ESA’s EO data) means the data generated by the ERS, Envisat and Earth Explorer missions. The ESA EO data can be split into two major groups: a) The free data set including data collections available on-line without any technical or financial constraints attached. The free data set comprises most of the data generated by the ESA EO missions. b) The restrained data set for which access priorities are managed differently, due to technical and financial constraints. The restrained data set comprises the data which are acquired or processed after specific PI demand (mainly the SAR data originating from the ERS and Envisat missions) and the data sets of very large volume (i.e. not suitable for transfer via Internet). A. Data Supply A.1. ESA provides the agreed amount and type of ESA data to the PI on-line for the free data set and on-line or on media for the restrained data set. A.2. ESA, while duly considering the interests of the PI, reserves the right to review, modify, suspend or terminate delivery of data at any time during the Project in the event that a) Funding of ESA mission or associated processing facilities operations cannot be sustained b) Satellite or related ground system failure occurs c) Planned activities of related ESA systems are suspended or cancelled in order to carry out special activities that ESA consider of high priority d) Status check of the respective satellite(s) or performance evaluation is needed. ESA may modify their mission operation plan(s) at any time, should they consider such corrective action necessary for ensuring mission success. A.3. The PI accepts to modify, suspend or terminate the utilization of ESA Data for the Project when so requested by ESA. The PI shall have no right whatsoever to claim for compensation or damage as a consequence of ESA’s decision to terminate or suspend the delivery of ESA data. A.4. ESA does not guarantee the suitability of ESA data for the purpose of the Project and shall not be held liable for any damage derived from the use of such data by the PI or any third party. A.5. ESA only upon request guarantees the confidentiality of communications, reports and other documentation submitted by the PI, to the extent mutually agreed. A.6. In the case of the restrained data set, the PI accepts that his project has a lower priority in case of conflict for SAR instrument planning with a project of higher priority. Projects of higher priority (i.e. Category-2 projects) an operational use of SAR data, as defined in the Revised ESA Data Policy for ERS, Envisat and Earth Explorer Missions B. General conditions of data utilization B.1. The PI is required to accept these Terms and Conditions before being able to receive ESA data. For the free data set, the registration and acceptation of these Terms and Conditions will authorise full access on-line to the requested data sets. For the restrained data set, the PI is required first to submit a project proposal, which shall be reviewed by ESA with regard to scientific relevance and required data. ESA notifies the PI of the acceptance of the proposal, assigning amaximum quota for instrument planning and/or for product delivery. Access to datais then granted upon acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. B.2. The PI acknowledges and takes account of scheduling and processing constraints both at satellite and ground segment levels. B.3. The PI understands that acceptance of these Terms & Conditions includes general acceptance of the related ESA Data Policy. Revised ESA Data Policy for ERS, Envisat and Earth Explorer Missions B.4. The PI assumes full responsibility for the approved utilization of data, including utilization with co-investigators. The PI provides ESA with a detailed list of all co-investigators. B.5. The PI is authorized to undertake duplication of data (sets) as necessary for the performance of the Project, without any charges to ESA. B.6. In the case of the free data set, the PI may be granted the right for onward distribution by ESA only upon request and confirmation by ESA. B.7. The PI and all authorized co-investigators together shall, at any time, observe the following conditions of use: a) Use all ESA data received exclusively for purposes of the Project b) Indemnify ESA for the full amount of any loss, expense, cost or liability (other than arising from any act, omission or direction of ESA) resulting from any utilization of data, for which ESA might be held responsible for any reason whatsoever; c) Not assign any rights, obligations or interests herein without the prior written approval by ESA B.8. In the cases described under A.2, the PI has no right whatsoever to claim for compensation or damage as a consequence of the decision of ESA. B.9. The PI waives any claim against ESA in the event of any damage directly or indirectly arising from malfunction or interruption in the transmission of data for any reason whatsoever. B.10. Costs of equipment to receive or read ESA data or any other costs associated with the execution of the Project will be borne and / or secured by the PI. B.11. The PI informs ESA in case of problems with data reception or data quality. B.12. The PI shall publish results of the Project in publications of international renown and present results at dedicated workshops organised by ESA. For a period of six months after Project completion, the PI has the exclusive right to publish the results; thereafter, this right will be shared with ESA unless the PI can demonstrate a character of Confidentiality * of the results. B.13. Any publication whatsoever resulting from work carried out using ESA data shall contain the following sentence: “Data provided by the European Space Agency.” The PI provides ESA with a free copy of any publication. ESA shall at any time have a royalty free right of publication and dissemination of these publications, unless the PI claims a character of Confidentiality * of his own results and to the extent that such reproduction and dissemination do not conflict with the rights of third parties. C. Intellectual Property Rights C.1. The PI acknowledges the full title and ownership, including all derived rights, by ESA of all ESA data. C.2. The PI clearly marks all ESA data and analysed information, irrespective of the form in which it is produced), as follows: © ESA (year of reception). C.3. In his sphere of influence, the PI guarantees respect of ESA’s intellectual property rights and reports any evidence of unlawful use, including such of third parties, immediately to ESA in writing. C.4. ESA’s title and copyright of data shall not prevent recognition of copyright in favour of PI which may arise as a result of the latter’s own interpretation of ESA processed data, inputs of data or knowledge from other sources. C.5. In case of emergence of own intellectual property rights from direct utilization of ESA data, the PI grants ESA free of charge, an irrevocable and non-exclusive license to use such intellectual property in the field of space research and technology. The PI informs ESA of applications for patents or similar forms of legal protection for such intellectual property within two months from the filing date. ESA treats such information as confidential during a period of eighteen months following original application, unless published before the expiration of this period by the PI. * The term Confidentiality * does not refer to classified information terminology.

The NASA Access Launchpad, also called \"Launchpad,\" is an online service that you can use to log into many applications, such as IdMAX and SATERN, with a single account. Whom do I contact for help? For help, contact the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) at 1-877-677-2123 (1-877-NSSC123), Option 2 or online at https://esd.nasa.gov/esdportal . I am a first time user; what is my user profile and how can I create one? Your NASA user profile consists of an Agency User ID (AUID), a specific password, and your completed set of answers to security questions. Having a user profile allows you to access many NASA applications. You will be able to create your profile after your identity has been created and activated. When that process is completed you will have received an email with instructions for setting up your profile and other necessary actions such as SATERN training. If you are not currently logged in, to create your profile just click the \"First Time User?\" button at the top of this page and follow the instructions; alternatively you can also go directly to https://id.nasa.gov/uss/ProfileCreate.uss . What is my Agency User ID and what if I don't remember it? An Agency User ID (AUID) is your user ID for many NASA applications. It is unique across the entire Agency (no one else has the same ID). If you do not remember your Agency User ID, just go to https://id.nasa.gov . On the Launchpad log in page, select \"Retrieve Agency ID\" in the header and enter the requested information to have it emailed to you. You can also go directly to https://id.nasa.gov/uss/AUIDRetrieval.uss . What password do I use to log into Launchpad? Your Launchpad password is setup after your profile creation. This is not the same password as your desktop log in. Ensure it is a unique one that you will remember. What if I forgot my password? If you have forgotten your password, go to https://id.nasa.gov and select the \"Expired/Forgotten Password\" from the header to answer your security questions and reset it. You can also go directly to https://id.nasa.gov/uss/PasswordReset.uss . How can I update my profile? To update your profile, such as editing security answers and questions, go to https://id.nasa.gov/ . Once you are logged in, click the \"My Login\" button and select an option from the drop-down menu. Can I update my personal information, like my email address, through Launchpad? No, you cannot use Launchpad for updating personal information. Instead, go to the NASA Identity User Self Service at https://id.nasa.gov . There you can edit your information such as email address, phone number, display name, common name and more. How do I request an RSA SecurID token? You, or your sponsor, need to submit a NAMS request for application \"Agency RSA SecurID Token\". What is an RSA Token Code? The RSA Token Code, sometimes referred to as the passcode, is slightly different depending on whether a hard token or soft token is used. For hard tokens, it’s a combination of your personal PIN + the code displayed on your token. For soft tokens, its simply the code displayed on your smart phone. What if I forgot my RSA SecurID PIN? If you have forgotten your PIN, please call the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) at 1-877-677-2123. What if my RSA SecurID token log in fails? Ensure you are entering your PIN correctly. And do not reuse the same token code twice; the codes are one time use. If you have entered your RSA token code incorrectly too many times your account may be locked. An email is sent to the primary registered email address on file when this occurs. Should you receive the locked notice, please call the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) at 1-877-677-2123. What if my Agency User ID log in fails? Passwords are case sensitive and must match exactly what is set on your account. Ensure you do not have caps lock on and the password being entered is the one you setup for the account. If you continue to receive the error, it is possible your account has been locked due to too many failed attempts. When this occurs, you can log in with an RSA SecurID token or smartcard, wait some time and try again, or reset your password by going to https://id.nasa.gov and selecting \"Expired/Forgotten Password\" link from the Launchpad log in page. What can I do if my smartcard log in fails? Remove and reinsert your smartcard into the card reader, restart the web browser, and try the log in again. If you have forgotten your PIN, the smartcard is damaged, or you need further assistance, please call the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) at 1-877-677-2123 (1-877-NSSC123), Option 2. If you are using Firefox, a manual configuration is required. The configuration details can be found below under “Which internet browsers are supported?” Why is my access limited if I don't use a smartcard or RSA SecurID token? Using one of the available two-factor methods of smartcard (preferred) or RSA SecurID token requires not only a PIN (something you know) but a physical device (something you have). This provides added security for the account and allows certain additional functions within some applications. How do I use my smartcard? The computer you are using to log in must be equipped with a card reader and configured with the required software, such as ActivClient. Insert your smartcard firmly into the card reader and select the smartcard log in option from the log in page. If you are already authenticated with another method such as RSA or Agency User ID and Password, go to https://id.nasa.gov/uss/Launchpad.uss and select the link to increase your access level. I have a non-NASA federal smartcard. Can I use it to log in? Non-NASA federal smartcards can be used for log in. In order to use the card you will need to go through the credential registration process. To initiate this please contact the security office. Which internet browsers are supported? Current vendor supported versions of the following browsers are supported: Windows: IE, Chrome, Firefox ESR Mac: Safari, Chrome, Firefox ESR Linux: Firefox ESR PIV support requires that NASA specified smartcard middleware is installed on the system. For more information on smartcard middleware and browser dependencies, please refer to the End User standards information located on the NASA CSET site: https://cset.nasa.gov/browser-configurations/ . Manual Configuration for Smartcard Support within Firefox To configure Firefox management of certificate trust: For smartcard access to NASA resources download and import the NASA Operational Certificate Authority (NOCA) certificate. NOCA is publicly hosted by the Department of the Treasury. To import the desired certificates into Firefox: Open Firefox Paste about:preferences#privacy in the URL bar Select the Privacy & Security tab on the left menu bar Scroll to the bottom of the page and select View Certificates Click Import and select the certificates downloaded earlier Select the desired Trust Levels when asked To configure Firefox to use smartcard: Windows 10: Option 1: Current versions of Firefox for Windows provide native support for smartcard but must be enabled. To enable support open Firefox Paste about:config in the browser bar Click Accept the Risk and Continue Paste security.osclientcerts.autoload in the config search bar Click the toggle button to enable it Boolean value should now be true Close browser and reopen Option 2: In this example HID ActivClient is the installed middleware. You will need to adjust based on your installed software. Open Menu > Options > Privacy & Security (Or copy and paste about:preferences#privacy in the URL bar and hit enter) Click on Security Devices (Scroll to the bottom of Privacy & Security) If \"ActivClient PKCS #11\" is not under Security Modules and Devices Click Load Change 'Module Name' if you prefer (name has no impact on functionality) For module filename paste the following and hit enter: C:/Program Files/HID Global/ActivClient/acpkcs211.dll Once Complete or If \"ActivClient PKCS #11\" is already under Security Modules and Devices Insert your smartcard Left-click your smartcard reader (find the one that lists Status as Not Logged in) Click Log In Enter your PIN (\"Password Required\" prompt should display) If status changes to \"Logged In\", then the smartcard was successfully unlocked Select \"Ok\" Close the Preference Pane RHEL 7 & 8: In this example OpenSC is the installed middleware on a 64-bit system. You will need to adjust based on your installed software Open Menu > Options > Privacy & Security (Or copy and paste about:preferences#privacy in the URL bar and hit enter) Click on Security Devices (Scroll to the bottom of Privacy & Security) If \"OpenSC\" is not under Security Modules and Devices Click Load Change 'Module Name' if you prefer (name has no impact on functionality) For module filename paste the following and hit enter: /usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs11.so Once Complete or If \"OpenSC” is already under Security Modules and Devices Insert your smartcard Left-click your smartcard reader (find the one that lists Status as Not Logged in) Click Log In Enter your PIN (\"Password Required\" prompt should display) If status changes to \"Logged In\", then the smartcard was successfully unlocked Select \"Ok\" Close the Preference Pane macOS 10.15 and newer: Due to changes in the OS, middleware is no longer supported. Current versions of Firefox for macOS provide native support for smartcard but must be enabled. To enable support open Firefox Paste about:config in the browser bar Click Accept the Risk and Continue Paste security.osclientcerts.autoload in the config search bar Click the toggle button to enable it Boolean value should now be true Close browser and reopen What is the best way to bookmark Launchpad? If you would like to log into an application that uses the Launchpad log in, you should bookmark the application URL, e.g., https://inwiki.nasa.gov. That way, you can visit it directly. Do not bookmark the Launchpad URL. What is Single Sign On (SSO) and how do I enable it? Single Sign On, SSO, is a mechanism that utilizes your smartcard log in to a NASA desktop to also access Launchpad-enabled applications. This allows you to bypass the Launchpad log in screen when going to applications (you will not be required to enter your credentials). SSO is only available when you are on a NASA computer while connected to the NASA internal network and the smartcard is used for system login. What is Alternate User Log In (namehint)? Alternate User Log In allows you to log in with additional account types when required by an application. A smartcard or NASA Privileged Access Managment password is required. For more details on this feature you must access this page from a NASA network. First Time User × To log in using NASA Access Launchpad you will need to create a profile. Creating your profile will allow you to set a password and security answers which will be used should you ever forget your password. Once it is completed your account will be enabled for log in.

What is my Agency User ID and what if I don't remember it? An Agency User ID (AUID) is your user ID for many NASA applications. It is unique across the entire Agency (no one else has the same ID). If you do not remember your Agency User ID, just go to https://id.nasa.gov . On the Launchpad log in page, select \"Retrieve Agency ID\" in the header and enter the requested information to have it emailed to you. You can also go directly to https://id.nasa.gov/uss/AUIDRetrieval.uss . What password do I use to log into Launchpad? Your Launchpad password is setup after your profile creation. This is not the same password as your desktop log in. Ensure it is a unique one that you will remember. What if I forgot my password? If you have forgotten your password, go to https://id.nasa.gov and select the \"Expired/Forgotten Password\" from the header to answer your security questions and reset it. You can also go directly to https://id.nasa.gov/uss/PasswordReset.uss . How can I update my profile? To update your profile, such as editing security answers and questions, go to https://id.nasa.gov/ . Once you are logged in, click the \"My Login\" button and select an option from the drop-down menu. Can I update my personal information, like my email address, through Launchpad? No, you cannot use Launchpad for updating personal information. Instead, go to the NASA Identity User Self Service at https://id.nasa.gov . There you can edit your information such as email address, phone number, display name, common name and more. How do I request an RSA SecurID token? You, or your sponsor, need to submit a NAMS request for application \"Agency RSA SecurID Token\". What is an RSA Token Code? The RSA Token Code, sometimes referred to as the passcode, is slightly different depending on whether a hard token or soft token is used. For hard tokens, it’s a combination of your personal PIN + the code displayed on your token. For soft tokens, its simply the code displayed on your smart phone. What if I forgot my RSA SecurID PIN? If you have forgotten your PIN, please call the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) at 1-877-677-2123. What if my RSA SecurID token log in fails? Ensure you are entering your PIN correctly. And do not reuse the same token code twice; the codes are one time use. If you have entered your RSA token code incorrectly too many times your account may be locked. An email is sent to the primary registered email address on file when this occurs. Should you receive the locked notice, please call the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) at 1-877-677-2123. What if my Agency User ID log in fails? Passwords are case sensitive and must match exactly what is set on your account. Ensure you do not have caps lock on and the password being entered is the one you setup for the account. If you continue to receive the error, it is possible your account has been locked due to too many failed attempts. When this occurs, you can log in with an RSA SecurID token or smartcard, wait some time and try again, or reset your password by going to https://id.nasa.gov and selecting \"Expired/Forgotten Password\" link from the Launchpad log in page. What can I do if my smartcard log in fails? Remove and reinsert your smartcard into the card reader, restart the web browser, and try the log in again. If you have forgotten your PIN, the smartcard is damaged, or you need further assistance, please call the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) at 1-877-677-2123 (1-877-NSSC123), Option 2. If you are using Firefox, a manual configuration is required. The configuration details can be found below under “Which internet browsers are supported?” Why is my access limited if I don't use a smartcard or RSA SecurID token? Using one of the available two-factor methods of smartcard (preferred) or RSA SecurID token requires not only a PIN (something you know) but a physical device (something you have). This provides added security for the account and allows certain additional functions within some applications. How do I use my smartcard? The computer you are using to log in must be equipped with a card reader and configured with the required software, such as ActivClient. Insert your smartcard firmly into the card reader and select the smartcard log in option from the log in page. If you are already authenticated with another method such as RSA or Agency User ID and Password, go to https://id.nasa.gov/uss/Launchpad.uss and select the link to increase your access level. I have a non-NASA federal smartcard. Can I use it to log in? Non-NASA federal smartcards can be used for log in. In order to use the card you will need to go through the credential registration process. To initiate this please contact the security office. Which internet browsers are supported? Current vendor supported versions of the following browsers are supported: Windows: IE, Chrome, Firefox ESR Mac: Safari, Chrome, Firefox ESR Linux: Firefox ESR PIV support requires that NASA specified smartcard middleware is installed on the system. For more information on smartcard middleware and browser dependencies, please refer to the End User standards information located on the NASA CSET site: https://cset.nasa.gov/browser-configurations/ . Manual Configuration for Smartcard Support within Firefox To configure Firefox management of certificate trust: For smartcard access to NASA resources download and import the NASA Operational Certificate Authority (NOCA) certificate. NOCA is publicly hosted by the Department of the Treasury. To import the desired certificates into Firefox: Open Firefox Paste about:preferences#privacy in the URL bar Select the Privacy & Security tab on the left menu bar Scroll to the bottom of the page and select View Certificates Click Import and select the certificates downloaded earlier Select the desired Trust Levels when asked To configure Firefox to use smartcard: Windows 10: Option 1: Current versions of Firefox for Windows provide native support for smartcard but must be enabled. To enable support open Firefox Paste about:config in the browser bar Click Accept the Risk and Continue Paste security.osclientcerts.autoload in the config search bar Click the toggle button to enable it Boolean value should now be true Close browser and reopen Option 2: In this example HID ActivClient is the installed middleware. You will need to adjust based on your installed software. Open Menu > Options > Privacy & Security (Or copy and paste about:preferences#privacy in the URL bar and hit enter) Click on Security Devices (Scroll to the bottom of Privacy & Security) If \"ActivClient PKCS #11\" is not under Security Modules and Devices Click Load Change 'Module Name' if you prefer (name has no impact on functionality) For module filename paste the following and hit enter: C:/Program Files/HID Global/ActivClient/acpkcs211.dll Once Complete or If \"ActivClient PKCS #11\" is already under Security Modules and Devices Insert your smartcard Left-click your smartcard reader (find the one that lists Status as Not Logged in) Click Log In Enter your PIN (\"Password Required\" prompt should display) If status changes to \"Logged In\", then the smartcard was successfully unlocked Select \"Ok\" Close the Preference Pane RHEL 7 & 8: In this example OpenSC is the installed middleware on a 64-bit system. You will need to adjust based on your installed software Open Menu > Options > Privacy & Security (Or copy and paste about:preferences#privacy in the URL bar and hit enter) Click on Security Devices (Scroll to the bottom of Privacy & Security) If \"OpenSC\" is not under Security Modules and Devices Click Load Change 'Module Name' if you prefer (name has no impact on functionality) For module filename paste the following and hit enter: /usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs11.so Once Complete or If \"OpenSC” is already under Security Modules and Devices Insert your smartcard Left-click your smartcard reader (find the one that lists Status as Not Logged in) Click Log In Enter your PIN (\"Password Required\" prompt should display) If status changes to \"Logged In\", then the smartcard was successfully unlocked Select \"Ok\" Close the Preference Pane macOS 10.15 and newer: Due to changes in the OS, middleware is no longer supported. Current versions of Firefox for macOS provide native support for smartcard but must be enabled. To enable support open Firefox Paste about:config in the browser bar Click Accept the Risk and Continue Paste security.osclientcerts.autoload in the config search bar Click the toggle button to enable it Boolean value should now be true Close browser and reopen What is the best way to bookmark Launchpad? If you would like to log into an application that uses the Launchpad log in, you should bookmark the application URL, e.g., https://inwiki.nasa.gov. That way, you can visit it directly. Do not bookmark the Launchpad URL. What is Single Sign On (SSO) and how do I enable it? Single Sign On, SSO, is a mechanism that utilizes your smartcard log in to a NASA desktop to also access Launchpad-enabled applications. This allows you to bypass the Launchpad log in screen when going to applications (you will not be required to enter your credentials). SSO is only available when you are on a NASA computer while connected to the NASA internal network and the smartcard is used for system login. What is Alternate User Log In (namehint)? Alternate User Log In allows you to log in with additional account types when required by an application. A smartcard or NASA Privileged Access Managment password is required. For more details on this feature you must access this page from a NASA network. First Time User × To log in using NASA Access Launchpad you will need to create a profile. Creating your profile will allow you to set a password and security answers which will be used should you ever forget your password. Once it is completed your account will be enabled for log in. To setup your profile, click the Create My Profile button below which will take you to User Self Service in order to complete the process. If you have already created your profile, you can close this dialog box and log in. Create My Profile"]},

Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) Keywords are a hierarchical set of controlled Earth Science vocabularies that help ensure Earth science data, services, and variables are described in a consistent and comprehensive manner and allow for the precise searching of metadata and subsequent retrieval of data, services, and variables. Initiated over twenty years ago, GCMD Keywords are periodically analyzed for relevancy and will continue to be refined and expanded in response to user needs. The categories of GCMD Keywords are as follows: Earth Science Earth Science Services Data Centers/Service Providers Projects Instruments/Sensors Platforms/Sources Locations Horizontal Data Resolution Vertical Data Resolution Temporal Data Resolution URL Content Types Granule Data Formats Measurement Names Chronostratigraphic Units The information provided on this page defines how GCMD Keywords are structured, used and accessed. It also provides information on how users can participate in the further development of the keywords. GCMD Keyword Forum The GCMD Keyword Forum , now part of the Earthdata Forum, provides keyword users and metadata providers with an area for discussion of topics related to GCMD Keywords. Participants are invited to use this forum to ask questions, submit keyword requests, discuss trade-offs, and track the status of keyword requests. More Information About the Keywords GCMD Keyword Structure GCMD Keywords are organized using a multi-level hierarchical structure. This hierarchical structure provides a framework by which concepts can be classified and related. The Earth Science and Science Services keyword sets use the following hierarchical structure: Category > Topic > Term > Variable > Detailed Variable Categories and Topics represent disciplines and high level concepts. Terms and Variables define subject areas and parameters. Detailed Variables are uncontrolled values that can be added by users to more specifically describe data. All other keyword sets use hierarchies designed for a specific concept. For example, \"Instruments\" uses Short Name > Long Name . Short name and long name define the name of the instrument used to acquire the data. Earth Science Keywords Structure The Earth Science Keywords have a six-level keyword structure with the option for a seventh uncontrolled field. Category and Topic levels define how the keywords are organized and the associated Earth science discipline within the hierarchy. The Term and Variables levels define the subject area, measured variables/parameters, and the hierarchical-type relationship for the subject area. Keyword Level Example Category Earth Science Topic Atmosphere Term Weather Events Variable Level 1 Subtropical Cyclones Variable Level 2 Subtropical Depression Variable Level 3 Subtropical Depression Track Detailed Variable (Uncontrolled Keyword) Earth Science Services Keywords Structure The Earth Science Services Keywords have a four-level keyword structure with the option for a fifth uncontrolled field. Category and Topic levels define how the controlled keywords are organized and the associated Earth Science Services discipline associated with the keyword in the hierarchy. The Term and Variable levels define the subject area, the type of software/service being described, and the hierarchical-type relationship for the subject area. Keyword Level Example Service Category Earth Science Services Service Topic Data Analysis and Visualization Service Term Geographic Information Systems Service Variable Web-Based Geographic Information Systems Detailed Variable (Uncontrolled Keyword) Data Center/Service Provider Keywords Structure The Data Center/Service Provider Keywords have a four-level keyword structure and a short name/long name that define the data center, service provider, organization, or institution responsible for distributing the data or developing the service. Keyword Level Example Level 0 Government Agencies-U.S. Federal Agencies Level 1 NASA Level 2 - Level 3 - Short Name LP DAAC Long Name Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center Project Keyword Structure The Project Keywords have a short name/long name that define the name of the scientific program, field campaign, or project from which the data were collected.

Where can I find the MODIS and VIIRS Active Fire User guides? For the most current information, use the Active Fire User Guides: VIIRS (Updated July 2018) MODIS Collection 6 Revision C (Updated December 2020) What are the key differences between URT/RT/NRT and Standard quality fire data? Standard data products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of Earth’s geophysical properties to support science. The ultra real-time (URT), real-time (RT), and near real-time (NRT) fire products are generated more rapidly than the standard processing allows to meet the needs of the applications community. To facilitate this, a number of changes have been made to the standard processing approach: For the URT and RT, direct broadcast data are used (see Questions about Real-Time (RT) and Ultra Real-Time (URT) active fire data ) and for NRT, data downlinked from the satellite are sorted, processed, and delivered in an expedited manner (as Session-based Production Data Sets). One key difference between the MODIS/Aqua NRT and Standard (Science Quality) Fire Products is the accuracy of the Fire locations (positions or geolocation). Unlike MODIS/Terra, VIIRS/Suomi NPP, and VIIRS/NOAA-20, the position of the Aqua satellite is not as well known when the NRT Fire Product is produced. Most of the time, the additional error introduced in the reported Fire location is small (< 100 m), but in some situations this position error may be large (several kilometers). In particular, the larger errors may occur after spacecraft maneuvers and during space weather events. The NRT Fire location accuracy is also degraded for MODIS/Terra, VIIRS/Suomi NPP, and VIIRS/NOAA-20 after spacecraft maneuvers, but the time period is typically shorter (< 2 hours for MODIS/Terra, VIIRS/Suomi NPP, and VIIRS/NOAA-20 vs. up to 12 hours for MODIS/Aqua). When the Standard Fire product are later processed, the best available satellite position data is used and the quality assurance team removes data degraded by spacecraft maneuvers. In addition, the Standard Fire products are typically later reprocessed and the Fire positions may be even more accurate in the reprocessed products. Routines used to derive Level 2 products (such as fire) do not make use of ancillary data, and so their codes are identical to the ones used in standard operations. However, please note: The data distributed via the FIRMS download tool does not contain the static sources/inferred hotspot \"type\" ( See the MODIS Active Fire User Guide ). The day/night column (also described on page 38 of the MODIS Active Fire User Guide) is currently calculated differently. The standard processing algorithm uses the solar zenith angle (SZA) to threshold the day/night value; if the SZA exceeds 85 degrees it is assigned a night value. SZA values less than 85 degrees are assigned a day time value. For the NRT algorithm the day/night flag is assigned by ascending (day) vs descending (night) observation. It is expected that the NRT assignment of the day/night flag will be amended to be consistent with the standard processing. What does a fire detection mean on the ground? Satellites take a ‘snapshot’ of events as they pass over Earth. Each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a pixel flagged as containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies (such as volcanoes). For MODIS the pixel is approximately 1 km and for VIIRS the pixel is approximately 375 m. The “location” is the center point of the pixel (not necessarily the coordinates of the actual fire). The actual pixel size varies with the scan and track (see: What does scan and track mean? ). The fire is often less than the size of the pixel (see: What size fires can be detected? ). We are not able to determine the exact fire size; what we do know is that at least one fire is located within the flagged pixel. Sometimes you will see several active fires in a line. This generally represents a fire front. Image Image What are the different sources of fire data in FIRMS? MODIS NRT C6.1 ( MCD14DL ) are the NRT MODIS (Terra and Aqua) Collection 6.1 data processed by NASA LANCE FIRMS. MCD14ML provided by FIRMS are a subset of the standard quality data processed by the MODIS Fire Team Science Computing Facility at the University of Maryland. These are available with a 2-3 month lag through the Archive Download Tool and can be viewed and queried in Fire Map . VIIRS 375 m NRT active fire data are available from Suomi NPP ( VNP14IMGTDL_NRT ) and NOAA-20 ( VJ114IMGTDL_NRT ). These are processed by NASA LANCE FIRMS. Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies (LFTA) product is generated from all daytime Operational Land Imager (OLI) acquisitions and currently provided for most of North America (CONUS, southern Canada and northern Mexico). The LFTA is currently produced through a collaboration by USGS EROS Data Center, NASA, and the USDA Forest Service. Daily Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI observations are processed by EROS and use the NASA-developed algorithm to produce active fire detection data that is ingested into FIRMS. Please note: A real-time (RT) and ultra real-time (URT) version of both MODIS and VIIRS active fire data are available for the US and Canada within minutes of satellite fly-over. See What are the real-time (RT) and ultra real-time (URT) data in FIRMS? . How often are the active fire data acquired? The MODIS instruments aboard the Terra and Aqua EOS satellites acquire data continuously, providing global coverage every 1-2 days. Terra (EOS AM) passes over the equator at approximately 10:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m., Mean Local Time (MLT), each day; Aqua (EOS PM) passes over the equator at approximately 1:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., MLT. There are at least 4 daily MODIS observations for almost every area on the equator, with the number of observations increasing (due to overlapping orbits) closer to the poles. The VIIRS instruments aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites also acquire data continuously. The 3,040 km VIIRS swath enables ≈15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator, thereby providing full global coverage every 12 hours. Suomi NPP has a nominal (equator-crossing) observation times at 1:30 p.m., MLT, and 1:30 a.m., MLT. NOAA-20 operates about 50 minutes ahead of Suomi NPP. Thanks to its polar orbit, mid-latitudes will experience 3-4 looks a day. How often is FIRMS updated? The FIRMS fire map is updated every 5 minutes, but please note that the data are derived from instruments onboard polar orbiting satellites (MODIS aboard Terra and Aqua and VIIRS aboard Suomi NPP and NOAA-20), and generally these have 2 overpasses a day (more towards the poles - see How often are the active fire data acquired? ). FIRMS generally makes the data available within 3 hours of a satellite observation (on a best effort basis). See also What time does the satellite pass over my area? The SHP KML CSV files are currently updated every 60 minutes. The near real-time alerts are run every 5 minutes. What time does the satellite pass over my area? In FIRMS Fire Map and NASA Worldview you can overlay the daily orbit tracks to see satellite acquisition times for your area of interest. Daily Terra, Aqua , Suomi NPP , and NOAA-20 global and regional orbit tracks are provided by https://www.space-track.org/ . For what dates are the fire data available? MODIS data are available from November 2000 (for Terra) and from July 2002 (for Aqua) to the present. VIIRS 375 m data are currently available from 20 January 2012 to the present (for Suomi NPP) and 1 January 2020 to the present (for NOAA-20). How are fires detected by satellite? Fire detection is performed using a contextual algorithm that exploits the strong emission of mid-infrared radiation from fires. The MODIS algorithm examines each pixel of the MODIS swath, and ultimately assigns to each pixel of the following classes: missing data, cloud, water, non-fire, fire, or unknown. More information can be found in: Giglio, L., Descloitres, J., Justice, C. O., & Kaufman, Y. (2003). An enhanced contextual fire detection algorithm for MODIS. Remote Sensing of Environment, 87: 273-282. doi:10.1016/S0034-4257(03)00184-6 In keeping with MODIS, the VIIRS algorithm is a hybrid thresholding and contextual algorithm using radiometric signals from 4 micron and 11 micron bands (M13 and M15, respectively) and additional bands and a suite of tests for internal cloud mask and rejection of false alarms. The product consists of simple file containing primarily latitude and longitude data for those pixels classified as thermal anomalies.

There are several reasons why MODIS or VIIRS may not have detected a certain fire: The fire may have started and ended between satellite observations; cloud cover, heavy smoke, or tree canopy may completely obscure a fire; occasionally the instruments are inoperable and can observe nothing during these times (see data outages and known issues for MODIS and VIIRS ); or the fire may have been too small or too cool to be detected. The VIIRS 375 m active fire product provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas due to its higher spatial resolution and it has improved nighttime performance. For more information on the minimum size of fire that can be detected using MODIS data see \" What is the smallest fire size that can be detected?\" and \" How do I know if a fire detection was missed due to cloud or missing data? \" What are the attributes / fields of the active fire data? Attribute table for VIIRS Attribute table for MODIS I only see fire data available for the last 7 days on your website. How can I get older data? Data for the last 2 months can be downloaded as text (TXT) files and older data can be obtained through the MODIS Fire Archive Download Tool or from MODIS directly from the MODIS Fire Team Science Computing Facility at the University of Maryland . MODIS data are available from from November 2000 (for Terra) and from July 2002 (for Aqua) to the present. VIIRS 375 m data are available from 20 January 2012 to the present (for Suomi NPP) and 1 January 2020 to the present (For NOAA-20). What projection are the shapefiles in? The shapefiles are in the Geographic WGS84 projection. What is the detection confidence? The confidence value was added to help users gauge the quality of individual fire pixels is included in the Level 2 fire product. The confidence field should be used with caution; it is likely that it will vary in meaning in different parts of the world. Nevertheless some of our end users have found such a field to be useful in excluding false positive occurrences of fire. They are different for MODIS and VIIRS. For MODIS, the confidence value ranges from 0% to 100% and can be used to assign one of the three fire classes (low-confidence fire, nominal-confidence fire, or high-confidence fire) to all fire pixels within the fire mask. In some applications errors of commission (or false alarms) are particularly undesirable, and for these applications one might be willing to trade a lower detection rate to gain a lower false alarm rate. Conversely, for other applications missing any fire might be especially undesirable, and one might then be willing to tolerate a higher false alarm rate to ensure that fewer true fires are missed. Users requiring fewer false alarms may wish to retain only nominal- and high-confidence fire pixels and treat low-confidence fire pixels as clear, non-fire, land pixels. Users requiring maximum fire detectability who are able to tolerate a higher incidence of false alarms should consider all three classes of fire pixels. For VIIRS, the confidence values are set to low, nominal, and high; they are based on a collection of intermediate algorithm quantities used in the detection process and are intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of Sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15 K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those free of potential Sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15 K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels. The confidence value is application specific. This isn't very helpful, but unfortunately there's no way to establish an optimal cutoff a priori. Users have to adopt an empirical approach—what threshold works best for what I'm trying to do? Unfortunately the confidence values in the product do not directly correspond to the statistical confidence levels in reference to Type I and Type II errors. Are there any restrictions on using data or imagery from FIRMS? NASA supports an open data policy and we encourage the appropriate use of data and graphics from FIRMS; when doing so, please take a moment to make sure you get the correct citation— see the Citation Policy . Please also read the LANCE Disclaimer and the About FIRMS web page . Back to top What caveats should be considered when using active fire data from FIRMS? Are there ever false fire detections or data artifacts? To avoid the occurrence of false alarms over bright/reflective surfaces (e.g., metallic factory rooftops), the VIIRS and MODIS algorithms use slightly more conservative tests to avoid the effects of Sun glint. Super Heated Smoke Plumes A few VIIRS active fire pixels are occasionally located outside the reported perimeter of a large wildfire. If this happens, users may need to look for additional clues to see if it is a data artifact. There have been a few instances when tall superheated plumes carrying large volumes of hot material into the air are formed over large and intense wildfires; when these occur the VIIRS instrument detects& the surface fire along with part of the plume and categorizes them as active fires. Those occurrences typically share the following set of conditions: (i) Nighttime detection. This is the period during which the VIIRS active fire product is particularly responsive to heat sources thereby favoring plume detection. However, this can also occur during the day time with; (ii) Very large wildfires undergoing explosive growth and accompanied by rapid/vertically elongated plume development. Enough hot material must entrain the plume creating a distinguishable thermal signal (i.e., one that significantly exceeds the fire-free surface background); (iii) High scan angle. This is what will ultimately produce the detections extending beyond the actual fire perimeter. The parallax effect causes the tall/superheated plume detection pixel(s) to be displaced laterally when projected onto the surface. Displaced pixels will be located on the fire perimeter’s side further away from the image center and closer to the swath’s edge. If those conditions apply, look for alternative observations (previous/next observation) acquired closer to nadir and try and prioritize the use of the fire detection data accordingly. Unfortunately, the VIIRS active fire algorithm isn’t currently able to distinguish nighttime surface fire pixels from the isolated plume detections due to strong similarities between their radiometric signatures. Related content: Is the VIIRS 375 m product still being refined? What is the detection confidence? False fires due to super heated smoke plume in nighttime detections (3 August 2018) Note on False Fires in VIIRS/NOAA-20 (17 July 2020) How do I know if a fire detection was missed due to cloud or missing data? An indication of cloud cover or missing data can be obtained by viewing the co-incident MODIS or VIIRS imagery in FIRMS Fire Map or Worldview . To take cloud and missing data in to account, it may be more appropriate to use one of the 1 km Level 3 or CMG fire products (see the discussion in the MODIS Fire User Guide ). How appropriate are the hotspot/fire locations for my research? The MODIS and VIIRS fire locations are good for determining the location of active fires, providing information on the spatial and temporal distribution of fires, and comparing data between years. The active fire pixel locations may not always be the most appropriate source of fire related information; the data do not provide any information on cloud cover or missing data. Depending on the analysis you are performing, it is sometimes possible to derive misleading or even incorrect results by ignoring the other types of pixels. In some cases it is more appropriate to use one of the Level 3 or CMG fire products. For more discussion on this, see FAQ \"What is the Climate Modeling Grid (CMD) fire product? and \"What is the difference between NRT and Standard quality fire data?\" What is the Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) fire product? The CMG fire products are gridded statistical summaries of fire pixel information intended for use in regional and global modeling. The products are currently generated at 0.5 degree spatial resolution for time periods of 1 calendar month (MOD14CMH/MYD14CMH) and 8 days (MOD14C8H/MYD14C8H). Higher resolution 0.25 degree CMG fire products will eventually be produced as well. More information can be found in the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User's Guide . Can active fires be detected below the forest canopy? The likelihood of detecting a fire beneath the tree canopy is unknown, but likely to be very low. Understory fires are typically small, and with the tree canopy obstructing the view of the fire, detection will be very unlikely. Are all active fire hotspots vegetation fires? No. An active fire represents the center of a pixel flagged as containing 1 or more actively burning hotspots /fires. In most cases fires are vegetation fires, but sometimes it is a volcanic eruption or the flare from a gas well. There is no way of knowing which type of thermal anomaly is detected based on the MODIS or VIIRS data alone. Can I estimate burned area from active fire data? It is not recommended to use active fire locations to estimate burned area due to spatial and temporal sampling issues. Determining this to an acceptable degree of accuracy is generally not possible due to nontrivial spatial and temporal sampling issues. For some applications, however, acceptable accuracy can be achieved, although the effective area burned per fire pixel is not simply a constant, but rather varies with respect to several different vegetation and fire-related variables. See Giglio et al. (2006) for more information. See \" Where can I get the MODIS burned area product? \" Can you use the active fire data for detecting volcanoes or volcanic eruptions? The algorithm routinely detects active volcanoes but the active fire product has not been validated against independent data for its ability to detect volcanoes. There is a separate near-real time MODIS product (MODVOLC) specifically for volcanoes—see http://modis.higp.hawaii.edu/ . What is FRP and what factors should be considered across sensors? Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is the rate of radiative energy emission per time unit from all fires within a pixel. FRP has been extensively used as a proxy of fire intensity to characterize fire types and is related to the rate of biomass combustion and rate of emissions. FRP estimates are provided for active fire data from MODIS, VIIRS and geostationary sensors used in FIRMS. Sensor spatial resolution, saturation temperature of thermal bands, satellite view zenith angle, time of satellite observation, etc. can affect the accuracy and variability of FRP estimates. Users should consider these factors whether comparing FRP information from a specific sensor or multiple sensors. Back to top Questions about VIIRS active fire data The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is an instrument aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 weather satellites. VIIRS was launched on Suomi NPP on October 28, 2011, and again on NOAA-20 (formally known as Joint Polar Satellite System-1 [JPSS-1]) on November 18, 2017. The VIIRS instrument will be launched on JPSS-2 in 2022 and join NOAA-20 and Suomi NPP in the same orbit. If you wish to view the VIIRS reflectance imagery that corresponds to the active fire detections, you can display this in FIRMS Fire Map or Worldview . What is the VIIRS 375 m Active Fire Product? The VIIRS 375 m ( VNP14IMGTDL_NRT ) active fire product is the latest product to be added to FIRMS. It provides data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. The 375 m data complements MODIS fire detections; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection, but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375 m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. What is the temporal frequency of the VIIRS 375 m fire data? The VIIRS instrument aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites acquire data continuously. The 3,040 km VIIRS swath enables ≈15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator, thereby providing full global coverage every 12 hours. Suomi NPP has a nominal (equator-crossing) observation times at 1:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., Mean Local Time (MLT); NOAA-20 operates about 50 minutes ahead of Suomi NPP. Thanks to its polar orbit, mid-latitudes will experience 3-4 looks a day. What is the spatial resolution of the data? The 375 m data describe the nominal resolution after native data are spatially aggregated (see figure below). Image Spatial resolution of VIIRS imagery data as a function of scan angle. The three distinct regions represent unique data aggregation zones extending from nadir to the edge of swath. The aggregation scheme changes across three distinct image regions. In the first region (nadir to 31.59° scan angle), three native pixels are aggregated in the along scan (cross-track) direction to form one data sample in the Level 1 image. In the second region (31.59° to 44.68° scan angle), two native pixels are aggregated to form one data sample. Finally in the third and last region (44.68° to 56.06° - edge of swath) one native pixel will result in one data sample. All five 375 m channels are aggregated onboard the spacecraft before the data are transmitted to the ground stations, whereas a subset of the VIIRS 750 m data (dual-gain channels only) are aggregated on the ground. What is the main difference between the VIIRS 375 m and 750 m active fire data? The two data products use similar methodologies to detect active fire pixels although differences in the spectral characteristics of the VIIRS channels used in each case led to unique algorithms. Because of its improved spatial resolution, the 375 m algorithm will tend to detect more fire pixels compared to the 750 m data set. That difference is particularly pronounced during the nighttime part of the orbit when the occurrence of smaller/cooler fires will favor the 375 m product. Will the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm always outperform the 750 m one? Generally speaking, the higher resolution product will achieve higher probability of fire detection in both day and nighttime scenes. However, areas subject to strong solar reflectance associated with Sun glint could see a few 750 m fire pixels without a corresponding 375 m fire detection. This is attributed to the relatively shorter wavelength of the 375 m mid-infrared channel used in the fire algorithm, which will experience greater influence of the solar component. In order to minimize the associated consequences, namely the occurrence of false alarms over bright/reflective surfaces (e.g., metallic factory rooftops), the 375 m algorithm uses slightly more conservative tests to avoid the effects of Sun glint over those areas. Are those few isolated fire pixels in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean real? Those occurrences are typically associated with spurious fire detections due to the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly. The 375 m active fire algorithm contains a specific filter to flag those occurrences as low confidence detections. However, in some cases (average 2-3 pixels every night) the spurious signal generated in the input Level 1 data is confused for a regular fire pixel and therefore assigned a nominal confidence flag. Note that verified true positives can also be found over South Atlantic Ocean waters along the southeast coast of Brazil and the west coast of Africa where oil rigs normally operate. Are the VIIRS 375 m (and 750 m) active fire data science-ready? The VIIRS active fire data have been extensively tested since routine production of the mission’s data record started in 19 January 2012. Numerous bad scan episodes (i.e., pixel clusters containing spurious radiances extending across the swath) were found in the Level 1 input data during the initial 18-24 months of the time series (Csiszar, et al., 2014). Those anomalies were gradually addressed by the VIIRS science team and their occurrence has dropped to virtually zero with the implementation of revised Level 1 data processing packages in 2015. Initial assessment of both VIIRS 375 m and 750 m was implemented over a few experimental sites indicating consistent fire detection and characterization performance. Additional data comparison analyses were implemented using near coincident Aqua/MODIS and TET-1 (German Aerospace Center) active fire data, which again showed consistent performance of the VIIRS active fire products across different observation conditions. Consequently, we consider the current data of good enough quality for use in fire management applications and scientific studies. However, users must be aware of the data quality limitations involving the archived data. NASA will be spearheading future data reprocessing efforts in order to generate a consistent time series for the VIIRS Level 1 and 2 data. Is the VIIRS 375 m product still being refined? Absolutely. The current suite represents the second release of the VNP14IMG and VNP14 active fire algorithms; data imperfections can—and likely will—occur. As with other satellite data products, the VIIRS active fire algorithm development undergoes routine quality control during which data issues such as omission errors, false alarms, and other anomalies are investigated and addressed. New versions of the products will be released once algorithm revisions are implemented and tested. Users are encouraged to report back to the science team when encountering potential data discrepancies. Where do I go for more information? Schroeder, W., Oliva, P., Giglio, L., & Csiszar, I. A.

If you wish to view the MODIS reflectance imagery that corresponds to the active fire detections, please go to Worldview . What does a MODIS active fire detection mean on the ground? Satellites take a ‘snapshot’ of events as they pass over earth. Each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a 1 km (approx.) pixel flagged as containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies (such as volcanoes). The “location” is the center point of the pixel (not necessarily the coordinates of the actual fire). The actual pixel size varies with the scan and track (see: What does scan and track mean? ). The fire is often less than 1 km in size (see: What size fires can be detected? ). We are not able to determine the exact fire size; what we do know is that at least one fire is located within that 1 km pixel. Sometimes you will see several active fires in a line. This generally represents a fire front. Image Are there any missing MODIS fire data? Terra was launched 18 December 1999 and Aqua was launched 4 May 2002. High quality active fire observations are available from the Terra satellite starting November 2000 and from the Aqua satellite starting 4 July 2002 onwards. In the fire data archive, there are several days where data were not collected and days with lower than usual fire counts due to reasons such as sensor outage. These include, but are not limited to: 15 April 2001, 15 June to 3 July 2001, and 19 to 28 March 2002. What does scan and track mean? The scan value represents the spatial-resolution in the East-West direction of the scan and the track value represents the North-South spatial resolution of the scan. It should be noted that the pixel size is not always 1 km across the scan track. The pixels at the “Eastern” and the “Western” edges of the scan are bigger than 1 km. It is 1 km only along the nadir (exact vertical from the satellite). Thus, the values shown for scan and track represent the actual spatial resolution of the scanned pixel. What is the brightness temperature? The brightness temperature of a fire pixel is measured (in Kelvin) using the MODIS channels 21/22 and channel 31. Brightness temperature is actually a measure of the photons at a particular wavelength received by the spacecraft, but presented in units of temperature. What are MODIS collections? Reprocessing of the entire MODIS data archive is periodically performed to incorporate better calibration, algorithm refinements, and improved upstream products into all MODIS products. The updated MODIS data archive resulting from each reprocessing is referred to as a collection. Later collections supersede all earlier collections. For Terra MODIS, Collection 1 consists of the first products generated following launch. Terra MODIS data were reprocessed for the first time in June 2001 to produce Collection 3. Note that this first reprocessing was numbered Collection 3, rather than Collection 2, as one would expect. Collection 3 was also the first produced for the Aqua MODIS products. Collection 4 reprocessing was initiated in December 2002 for Terra MODIS and somewhat later for the Aqua MODIS. Collection 5 began reprocessing in early 2007. Improvements in Collection 5 included adding the Fire Radiative Power value to the fire detections and refining the detection confidence to more accurately identify questionable active fire pixels. Collection 6 is the latest collection and uses the most up-to-date algorithms. In terms of fire detections, the key differences between Collection 5 and Collection 6 are that: Collection 6 extends processing to oceans and other large bodies, including detection of off-shore gas flaring; there is also a reduction in false alarms in the Amazon caused by small forest clearings and there will be an improved cloud mask. MODIS Process Version : For the standard quality data there is also a production code version number, e.g., 6.02 (Collection 6.0 process version 2). See the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User's Guide Revision C . Where can I get the MODIS burned area product? MODIS Active Fire & Burned Area Products web site and the MODIS Burned Area User Guide (Updated December 2020) and the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User Guide . What size fires can be detected? In any given scene the minimum detectable fire size is a function of many different variables (scan angle, biome, Sun position, land surface temperature, cloud cover, amount of smoke and wind direction, etc.), so the precise value will vary slightly with these conditions. MODIS routinely detects both flaming and smoldering fires 1000 m 2 in size. Under very good observing conditions (e.g., near nadir, little or no smoke, relatively homogeneous land surface, etc.) flaming fires one tenth this size can be detected. Under pristine (and extremely rare) observing conditions even smaller flaming fires 50 m 2 can be detected. It is not recommended to estimate burned area from the active fire data, see: Can I estimate burned area using the active fire data? . Unlike most contextual fire detection algorithms designed for satellite sensors that were never intended for fire monitoring (e.g., AVHRR, VIRS, ATSR), there is no upper limit to the largest and/or hottest fire that can be detected with MODIS. Image The diagram shows the day and night relationship of fire size and fire temperature, in different biomes, to the probability of being detected by MODIS ( Giglio, et al. (2003) ). What validation of the MODIS active fire products has been performed? Validation of the Terra MODIS Fire Product has primarily been performed using coincident observations from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) ; see the MODIS Land Team Validation page, and publications by Csiszar, et al. (2006) and two publications from Morisette, et al. (2005) for details. A very brief discussion of the general validation procedure, with some preliminary results, can be found in the Justice, et al. (2002) publication. Where can I get more information on the MODIS Fire Products? For more information on the active fire product and other MODIS fire products, please refer to the papers by Louis Giglio found here as well as the MODIS Active Fire Burned Area Products website and the MODIS Burned Area User Guide (Updated December 2020) and the MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product User Guide (Updated December 2020) . Back to top Questions about Real-Time (RT) and Ultra Real-Time (URT) active fire data What are the real-time (RT) and ultra real-time (URT) data in FIRMS? NASA EOSDIS defines real-time (RT) data as data that are available to the end user within one hour of the satellite fly-over (see What is Data Latency? and What time does the satellite pass over my area? ). Ultra real-time (URT) data are available much quicker—within minutes. Within FIRMS, the URT data are available within a minute of satellite overpass for select direct readout stations in the U.S. and Canada. What is \"direct broadcast\"? Direct broadcast, In addition to storing collected observation data for later download at designated intervals, some satellites have the capability to immediately broadcast this raw data to the ground. This is known as direct broadcast . As Earth is observed by the satellite, the data are formatted and transmitted to any user below with an antenna and other necessary equipment to receive and process the data. The Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, and NOAA-20 satellites all have direct broadcast capability. What is \"direct readout\"? The acquisition of freely transmitted direct broadcast satellite data by users with compatible ground receiving equipment is known as direct readout . Data can be collected by direct readout ground stations while they are in direct line of sight to satellites while they are visible above the horizon. Are there particular differences between URT data, RT data and NRT data? Ultra Real-Time (URT), Real-Time (RT), and Near Real-Time (NRT) data are all relative forms of low-latency data products made available more quickly than standard processing to support environmental monitoring, response to hazard/disaster events, etc. NRT data processing frameworks, such as NASA LANCE, leverage operational Level 0 global data streams for several NASA missions and provide Level 2 products 1-3 hours of satellite overpass. RT and URT data are predicated on the use of raw satellite data collected via direct readout ground stations. These ground stations are operated by various agencies and institutions, located around the globe and provide regional coverage. Ground stations typically process raw direct readout data to Level 0 to Level 1 to Level 2 data 30-60 minutes over satellite overpass and are considered RT data. Recently developed data processing technologies can now process direct readout data from Level 0 to Level 2 data products within 1 minute of satellite observation and are considered URT data. How are URT active fire detection data integrated and used with NRT active fire detection data in FIRMS? URT active fire detection data provided by select ground stations are integrated into FIRMS fire maps, KMZs and web map services within minutes of satellite observation. NRT active fire detection data replace the URT data in FIRMS mapping and data products and services as they become available 1-3 hours later. This integration of the data is seamless and not noticeable to the user unless there is a temporary anomaly occurring in either data source (e.g., a gap or artifact in the URT direct readout data stream). How do I identify the NRT, RT and URT data? FIRMS Fire Map and Map Services : To view the NRT, RT, and URT data in the FIRMS fire map, select the \"Time Based\" option in FIRMS. This symbolizes the active fire detections by time since detection. Both RT and URT data will display in the <1 hour category while NRT data will display in the 1-3 hour category or later categories. Click on active fire detection locations to view the attributes. The RT and URT fires will have a “Version” value (e.g., 2.0) followed by “RT” or “URT”. NRT fires will have a Version” value followed by “NRT.” FIRMS KMZs : \"Active fire detection footprint and centroid\" KMZs symbolize active fire detection by time since detection. Time since detection KMZs symbolizes the active fire detections by time since detection. Both RT and URT data will display in the <1 hour category while NRT data will display in the 1-3 hour category or later categories. RT and URT data are not distinguished in the KMZ attributes. Are URT data provided for all FIRMS products? So far, URT active fire detection data are available in FIRMS interactive maps, KMZs, and web services. Are URT data provided globally? URT data are currently provided by four (4) select direct readout ground stations—one in Mayaguez, PR (red) and Hampton, VA (black) and two in Madison, WI (blue) (see graphic below). Each ground station can receive direct readout data when satellite orbits intersect their respective station masks. Additional United States ground stations will continue to be integrated with the objective of providing URT coverage for the U.S., Canada, and Central America. Integration of ground stations elsewhere on the globe will be evaluated and determined at a later date. Image Current (solid lines) and Planned (dotted lines) Coverage of Ultra Real-Time and Real-Time Active Fire Data What is the objective of providing URT data? Remote sensing observations and derived science products provide a \"snapshot\" of conditions at the time of satellite observation and are used to assess the situation and inform decisions. Consequently, the value of satellite data used for operational detection and monitoring of wildfires and other hazard/disaster events is inversely proportional to their latency. In other words, the value of the data typically increases with decreasing latency in data availability since satellite observation. Back to top Geostationary active fire data How are \"geostationary\" active fire data different from the other data provided by FIRMS? Geostationary satellite sensors view the same area of Earth’s surface at all times while polar-orbiting sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS, typically view the same area of Earth’s surface twice daily. Consequently, geostationary satellite sensors can provide repeated observations on a sub-hourly basis, making it possible to detect fires not detectable at longer temporal intervals. Geostationary satellites provide data at 10-15 minute intervals, so they can detect more fire events and capture their growth and change. However, the spatial resolution of geostationary satellite data are coarser and therefore less sensitive to small fires. Where does the geostationary active fire data come from and how can I get more information about them?

The attributes are described in the following table: Attribute Short Description Long Description Latitude Latitude (decimal degrees) Latitude of pixel center. Note: Pixel size/dimension is affected by satellite view geometry and curvature of Earth’s surface. Consequently, pixel size becomes more distorted (larger) with increasing distance from the point immediately below the satellite. The reported coordinate is the center of each pixel’s footprint.

GOES active fire detections occur every 10 minutes and should be available within FIRMS in approximately 20-30 minutes. SEVIRI active fire detections occur every 15 minutes and should be available within FIRMS in approximately 30 minutes. Himawari active fire detections occur every 10 minutes and should be available within FIRMS in approximately 30 minutes. What size of fires can be detected with geostationary satellite observations? GOES - The theoretical minimum detectable fire size is approximately 0.004 km 2 at nadir in optimum viewing conditions, burning at 800 K (Schmidt et al., 2013). Meteosat SEVIRI - The theoretical minimum detectable fire size for “actively burning fires” is approximately 0.0001 of the area of a 3km SEVIRI pixel at nadir or approximately 0.0009km 2 (900m 2 ) (Schmidt et al., 2013). Himawari - Documentation describing the minimum detectable fire size of Himawari AHI using JAXA's Wild Fire product algorithm is currently limited but performance is anticipated to be similar to GOES ABI. Several recent research efforts demonstrate the use of Himawari AHI using customized/adapted fire detection algorithms with varying results. Please see the following papers: Schmidt, C., Hoffman, J., Prins, E., and Lindstrom, S. (2013).

NOAA NESDIS STAR, https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goesr/documents/ATBDs/Baseline/ATBD_GOESR_FIRE_v2.6_Oct2013.pdf Wooster, M. J., Roberts, G., Freeborn, P. H., Xu, W., Govaerts, Y., Beeby, R., He, J., Lattanzio, A., Fisher, D., and Mullen, R. (2015). LSA SAF Meteosat FRP products – Part 1: Algorithms, product contents, and analysis. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 15(22): 13217–13239. doi:10.5194/acp-15-13217-2015 What is the spatial resolution of the geostationary satellite observations? The thermal bands, used to detect active fires, have a spatial resolution directly below the satellite (known as the “sub-satellite point”) of 2km for GOES and Himawari, and 3km for Meteosat SEVIRI. However, as already noted, the spatial resolution of the pixel (i.e., the pixel size) systematically grows away from the sub-satellite point towards the edge of the disk (Figures 1-4). Please note each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a pixel flagged as containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies (such as volcanoes). Image Please note the pixel size systematically grows away from the sub-satellite point towards the edge of the disk (see Figures 1 - 4). The following figures (Figures 1-4) illustrate how the spatial resolution of the geostationary satellites increases away from the sub-satellite point - please note all measurements are in km 2 . Image Figure 1. Coverage of GOES-18 indicating the variation in pixel area (in km²) Image Figure 2. Coverage of GOES-16 indicating the variation in pixel area (in km²). Image Figure 3. Coverage of MSG SEVIRI indicating the variation in pixel area (in km²). Image Figure 4. Coverage of Himawari-8 indicating the variation in pixel area (in km²). Why are the geostationary fire data filtered in FIRMS? The SEVIRI and Himawari data are made available from EUMETSAT and CAM. The data have a 65-degree view zenith angle cut-off due to the large pixel size at high latitudes. Sun glint and bright areas particularly over water may cause spurious fire detections. The following images provide examples of where spurious fire detections have been noted. Image This series (1 of 3) of FIRMS screenshots are from August 11, 2022 showing fires detected in the Serra da Estrela National Park, Portugal. This first screenshot shows a MODIS/Terra 7,2,1 Corrected Reflectance, which shows burned area in reddish-brown and an active fire front in orange. Image Image 2 of 3 this series of FIRMS screenshots from August 11, 2022 showing fires detected in the Serra da Estrela National Park, Portugal. This second screenshot shows a MODIS/Terra 7,2,1 Corrected Reflectance, overlain with VIIRS active fire detections shown as red pixels. Image Image 3 of 3 in this series of FIRMS screenshots from August 11, 2022 showing fires detected in the Serra da Estrela National Park, Portugal. This third screenshot shows a MODIS/Terra 7,2,1 Corrected Reflectance, overlain with VIIRS active fire detections shown as red pixels and Meteosat-11 SEVIRI FRP pixels shown as pink pixels. Some spurious SEVIRI fire detections are evident. The FDC algorithm is still under development. The data shown in FIRMS are filtered to show fire detections with higher confidence values; these are classes 10 and 30, and 11 and 31. These criteria are driven by the validation analysis (See Hall et al 2019) and a qualitative review of the current algorithm output. The full list of classes available is outlined in the table below: Class Description 10 or 30 Good quality (highest confidence) fire detections** 11 or 31 Saturated fire pixel** 12 or 32 Cloud contaminated fire pixel 13 or 33 High probability fire pixels that do not satisfy requirements to be categorized as good quality fire detections 14 or 34 High probability fire pixels that do not satisfy requirements to be categorized as good quality fire detections 15 or 35 Low probability fire pixels that do not satisfy requirements to be categorized as good quality fire detections **indicates the classes shown in FIRMS Our qualitative assessment indicates some spurious fire detections are showing (see example below). This could be due to sun glint or bright water, so users are requested to use the data with caution. If in doubt, we recommend users look for coincident fire detections from MODIS or VIIRS in the vicinity. If they are present, the user can have more confidence in the geostationary data. Image In this screenshot from FIRMS, on 15 July 2022, the GOES FDC data from NOAA (shown in pink) along the lake edge are thought to be false positives / spurious fire detections. Users should exercise caution when using the data. What validation of geostationary active fire data has been conducted? Satellite-derived active fire products are validated with spatially and temporally coincident observations from higher resolution sensors. Landsat and Sentinel-2 are both appropriate sensors for validating geostationary active fire products. Given the Landsat and Sentinel-2 overpass times, any validation efforts will be focused on certain times of the day, therefore, false positives associated with (for example) unique solar angle issues may be missed.

FRP-PIXEL Product The key outputs from the FRP-PIXEL algorithm are active fire pixel detections and fire characteristics including fire radiative power (FRP), FRP uncertainty, active fire temperature, and fire detection confidence levels. The detection algorithm used in the FRP-PIXEL product is based on the principles applied to generate active fire detections within the MODIS Fire Products (Giglio et al., 2003). The algorithm works on statistics derived primarily from middle-infrared (MIR) and thermal infrared (TIR1) brightness temperature imagery. On a first pass, a series of absolute thresholds applied to these data are used to detect “potential” fire pixels. These pixels are then further assessed as true or false fire detections based on a series of further contextual tests based on statistics derived from immediate neighboring non-fire background pixels. A more complete description of the algorithm can be found in (Govaerts et al., 2010; Wooster et al., 2015). The FRP-PIXEL product is available every 15 minutes for the SEVIRI full-disk and every 10 minutes for the AHI and ABI disks. The spatial resolution of the product at the sub-satellite point is 3-km for the SEVIRI data and 2-km for the AHI and ABI, but the pixel size systematically grows with increasing view zenith angle (VZA) from the sub-satellite point towards the edge of the disk (See: What is the spatial resolution of the geostationary satellite observations? ). GOES FDC-HSC Product The FDC-HSC product is available every 10 minutes and contains information on the fire pixel locations, sub-pixel fire characteristics including active fire area and temperature, and FRP. The current FDC-HSC algorithm is a multispectral contextual algorithm designed to identify fire pixels through a decision-tree approach comparing them with their neighboring non-fire background pixels. The FDC-HSC algorithm uses a two-step approach. The first step is designed to identify all potential fire pixels while the second step further confirms and then characterizes the sub-pixel fire activity. What are the Product Uncertainties and Limitations? The FRP-PIXEL and FDC-HSC products are subject to several sources of uncertainties due to the characteristics of geostationary satellite full-disk data and associated image processing. Among these limitations: The spatial resolution of the data leads to missed smaller/less intense fires. Furthermore, the sensitivity to small/less intense fires varies away from the sub-satellite point. The FRP-derived value is sensitive to the fire location within the pixel. This effect is due to the shape of the point spread function, i.e., its departure from an ideal rectangular box. A fire located at the center of the instrument’s instantaneous field-of-view will elevate the pixel temperature much more than a fire located far away from its center. The non-linearity of the SEVIRI 3.9-μm channel above 310 K and the saturation of that band above 335 K can produce errors in the FRP estimate. Similarly, the saturation of the GOES-R ABI and AHI 3.9-μm channel above 400 K can produce errors in FRP. Back to top Landsat Fire Data What is the Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies Product? The Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies (LFTA) product is predicated on previous NASA-sponsored research to develop an active fire detection algorithm for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) aboard Terra. ASTER multispectral imagery and derived active fire detection data have been routinely used over the past two decades to validate active fire products from MODIS and geostationary sensors. The LFTA product was added to FIRMS in August 2022. Developed under the auspices of the NASA Applied Sciences Wildland Fire Program, the product is based on multispectral imagery acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites. The 30 m active fire detection data has 1,000 times and 160 times finer spatial resolution than the 1 km MODIS and 375 m VIIRS active fire detections, respectively. However, unlike MODIS and VIIRS, Landsat does not provide comprehensive global coverage on a daily basis. Each Landsat satellite typically images the same location on Earth every 16 days, but provides spatially explicit data and detail of observable fire activity at the time of the satellite overpass. These data augment fire management capabilities when available and can potentially enable applications at tactical scales. The LFTA product is generated from all daytime OLI acquisitions and currently provided for most of North America (CONUS, southern Canada and northern Mexico). Increased geographic coverage for the product is under consideration and will be investigated in the near future. Targeted nighttime OLI data collection for most of North America is also possible (OLI data are collected by request at nighttime), potentially increasing the opportunity for more frequent observations for selected geographic areas of heightened wildfire activity, but opportunities for nighttime observations are much more limited due to several factors. What is the temporal frequency of Landsat observations and derived active fire data? The OLI sensor aboard the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites each image the entire Earth every 16 days at the mid latitudes. The respective orbits of the two satellites are 8 days out of phase so when considered collectively, the entire planet is imaged at least every 8 days. Active fire detection data are derived from multispectral imagery acquired by OLI and provided daily for each of the scheduled WRS-2 paths imaged by Landsat 8 and 9 on a given date. Please consult the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 orbit tracks on the FIRMS fire maps to visualize the time of Landsat observations for a selected date (as depicted below). Additional active fire detection data from tasked nighttime Landsat OLI observations are possible, but not routinely conducted. Image The FIRMS fire map interface can display Landsat orbit tracks for user-selected dates with time of observation. True color and false color Landsat HLS imagery can also be displayed to view with active fire detection data. This display of a June 6, 2022, Landsat 8 acquisition provides the user the coverage provided by a single 185 km Landsat swath. What is the spatial resolution of the Landsat observations and derived active fire data? Each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a 30 m pixel flagged as containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies (such as active volcanoes). The “location” is the center point of the pixel (not necessarily the coordinates of the actual fire). What size of fires can be detected with Landsat? Landsat provides better active fire detection performance compared to coarser spatial resolution sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS. Flaming fires as small as approximately 4 m 2 have a better than 50% chance of detection during the daytime observations. Nighttime detection of similar fire activity improves to an area as small as 1 m 2 . Image Schroeder, W., Oliva, P., Giglio, L., Quayle, B., Lorenz, E., & Morelli, F. (2016). Active fire detection using Landsat-8/OLI data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 185: 210-220. doi:10.1016/j.rse.2015.08.032 Why are Landsat fire data only available for North America? The Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies (LFTA) product is currently produced through a collaboration by USGS EROS Data Center, NASA, and the USDA Forest Service. Daily Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI observations are processed by EROS and use the NASA-developed algorithm to produce active fire detection data that is ingested into FIRMS. Currently, only Landsat 8 and 9 OLI data collected by the USGS EROS Landsat Ground Station in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, are used to produce active fire detection data. The coverage of the USGS EROS Landsat Ground Station in Sioux Falls is highlighted in the figure below. Expansion of the geographic coverage for the product is possible through the integration of additional near real-time Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI data from other ground stations. Feasibility to include additional ground stations for North America and elsewhere is currently being investigated. Image Landsat ground stations for North America. The USGS EROS Landsat ground station (South Dakota) and the NOAA Gilmore Creek ground station both collect Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI data. The Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation ground station (Canada) collects Landsat 8 OLI data. Recorded and real-time OLI data from Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 are collected by the EROS and Gilbert Creek ground stations when either satellite is within \"line of sight\". This condition is achieved when the Landsat orbit passes within the green circles on the map. Near real-time Landsat 8 OLI data can be collected by the Prince Albert ground station when Landsat 8 is within its \"line of sight\" (red circle). What is the temporal extent of Landsat Active Fire and Thermal Anomalies product in FIRMS? The temporal extent of Landsat active fire data currently reaches back to June 2022. Processing of earlier acquisitions by Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 is possible, but not planned at this time. What are the attributes of the Landsat fire data? The attributes are described in the following table: Attribute Short Description Long Description Satellite Satellite L8 = Landsat 8; L9 = Landsat 9 Latitude Latitude (decimal degrees) Latitude of pixel center Longitude Longitude (decimal degrees) Longitude of pixel center Path Path Path number as identified in the World Reference System-2 (WRS-2) Row Row Row number as identified in the World Reference System-2 (WRS-2) Track Track The pixel location in the along-track dimension of the Landsat path based on the OLI Line-of-Sight (LOS) coordinate system. Generally increases in value from north to south for daytime and nighttime overpasses. Scan Scan The pixel location in the cross-track dimension of the Landsat path based on the OLI Line-of-Sight (LOS) coordinate system. Generally increases in value from west to east for daytime and nighttime overpasses. Acquire_Time Date and time of start of scan Date and time of acquisition/overpass of the satellite (in UTC). The format is YYYY-MM-DD followed by HH:MM-SS. For example, 2022-07-23 10:09:00. Confidence Confidence Value domain: H, M, and L: H: Higher confidence M: Medium confidence L: Lower confidence Version Version (FIRMS reference only) 1.0.7 NRT DayNight Day or Night D= Daytime fire, N= Nighttime fire What validation of the Landsat fire products has been performed? Validation of the Landsat active fire product has primarily been performed using available high resolution aerial and commercial satellite imagery and coincident/near coincident 1 km Terra and Aqua MODIS active fire data, and 750 m and 375 m Suomi NPP VIIRS active fire data. A discussion of the validation procedures and results can be found in Schroeder, et al. (2016). Where can I find more information about the Landsat fire data? The Landsat active fire detection algorithm is based on the legacy algorithm developed for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Development of the Landsat algorithm was conducted under the auspices of the NASA Applied Sciences Program . Please refer to the following papers by Louis Giglio and Wilfrid Schroder and the NASA Applied Sciences Program project summary for more information on the Landsat active fire algorithm and product. Schroeder, W., Oliva, P., Giglio, L., Quayle, B., Lorenz, E., & Morelli, F. (2016). Active fire detection using Landsat-8/OLI data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 185: 210-220. doi:10.1016/j.rse.2015.08.032 Giglio, L., Csiszar, I., Restás, Á., Morisette, J. T., Schroeder, W., Morton, D., & Justice, C. O. (2008). Active fire detection and characterization with the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER). Remote Sensing of Environment, 112(6): 3055-3063. doi:10.1016/j.rse.2008.03.003 How does Landsat active fire data compare with MODIS and VIIRS active fire data? Landsat active fire data are more than 1,000 times more resolute than MODIS and more than 150 times more resolute than VIIRS. The algorithm routinely detects fires as small as a few square meters or smaller, providing spatially explicit detail of the location and extent of fire activity at the time of a satellite overpass. Active fire fronts and scattered smaller fires within the fire perimeter are routinely detected. However, these relatively high spatial resolution data are provided at a lower temporal resolution compared to the daily observation frequency afforded by MODIS and VIIRS. Between both Landsat OLI instruments, areas in the lower to mid latitudes are imaged every 8 days. The temporal resolution of Landsat data can be increased though the collection of nighttime Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 imagery for targeted areas. The following graphic shows Landsat active fire data compared for MODIS (Terra and Aqua) (1km) and VIIRS (Suomi NPP and NOAA-20) (375m) for the Double Creek Fire in Northeast Oregon on September 10, 2022. Image Multi sensor imaging of the Double Creek Fire in Oregon on 10 September 2022. Active fire detections derived from Landsat-9/OLI 30 m (displayed on a Landsat 9 HLS surface reflectance image), Terra/MODIS 1 km, Aqua/MODIS 1 km, Suomi NPP/VIIRS 375 m and NOAA-20/VIIRS 375 m (all displayed on respective MODIS and VIIRS corrected reflectance images), are marked in yellow. Temporal span for these consecutive images is approximately 3 hours. Why does the latency differ between the Landsat active fire detection data and the HLS Landsat imagery? Landsat active fire detection data are produced in collaboration with the USGS EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Daily Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI imagery for the continental United States, southern Canada, and northern Mexico are captured via the Landsat ground station at EROS. This imagery is formatted and pre-processed in near real-time by the USGS and further processed onsite at EROS using NASA algorithms to extract 30-meter active fire detection data and made available for ingest into FIRMS approximately 30 minutes after a satellite overpass. Landsat imagery in FIRMS is processed as part of the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel-2 (HLS) project to create BRDF-adjusted, 30-meter Landsat and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products. Generated separately as provisional/research NASA products, HLS currently has a latency requirement of < 7 days. Consequently, FIRMS users desiring to view Landsat active fire detection data in the context of HLS Landsat true and false color composite imagery are required to wait until the processing of the HLS imagery is complete and made available in FIRMS. The HLS imagery is currently processed and available in FIRMS 2-4 days after acquisition, which is less than the current HLS processing latency requirement. Opportunities to reduce the latency of HLS imagery processing and its availability in FIRMS will continue to be assessed by NASA and implemented if possible. Back to top FIRMS Fire Map Can I download the fire data from the FIRMS Fire Map? Active fire data are not currently available for download via Fire Map. However, active fire locations from MODIS and VIIRS are available for download for the last 24 hours, last 48 hours, and last 7 days on the Active Fire Data page. Older MODIS and VIIRS data can be obtained through the Archive Download Tool . How can I share what I see in the Fire Map viewer with others? You can create a customized view of imagery and geospatial data in the Fire Map viewer focused on a particular area of interest and share it with others as a PNG, JPG, GIF, or GeoTIFF image.

What are the different sources of fire data in Fire Map? See What are the different sources of data in FIRMS? What does today vs 24 hours mean? \"Today\" will show active fire detection data from 0000 GMT to present. “24 hours” will display active fire detection data from 0000 GMT yesterday to present. What is the best way to view smoke in Fire Map? To view smoke add one of the corrected reflectance layers from MODIS or VIIRS from \"backgrounds\". In addition, you could add the OMPS Aerosol Index and OMPS Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) from the \"overlays\" section. OMPS AI detects and measures the density of smoke and suspended particles in the vertical air column in the atmosphere. Typical values of the aerosol index range from 0 to 5 and indicate dust storms or biomass burning smoke located in the lower troposphere (1-3 km). For AI values significantly higher than 5, use the OMPS Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) layer. Larger AI values between 5 and 10 usually indicate dense smoke from intensely burning fires that reach higher in the troposphere. Once the AI gets above 10, the smoke has likely been produced from a pyroCb event, with dense smoke lofted into the upper troposphere and, often, into the stratosphere. The Aerosol Index layer is useful for identifying and tracking smoke from wildfires or biomass burning events as well as dust from desert dust storms and the long-range transport of volcanic ash from volcanic eruptions. Values of 5.0 indicate heavy concentrations of aerosols that could reduce visibility or impact human health. Back to top Email Alerts Can you notify me when a fire occurs in my area of interest? We have developed a global fire email alert system to notify users when a fire occurs in or near a specified area of interest, country, or protected area. You can subscribe to receive near-real time, daily, or weekly email alerts in English, Spanish, or French. To subscribe or learn more about the email based alert system, please see the FIRMS Email Alerts page. Do you provide mobile/cell phone text messages? No. We do not currently provide SMS text messages.

I requested a CSV file with my email alert but I can’t see the file attached to my email alert, where is it? If the number of fires in the alert exceeds 90,000, a link to download the CSV file will be provided instead of an attachment. CSV files are stored for 14 days on the FIRMS server. I have received a CSV file as part of my Email Alert, can I add it as a layer in a Desktop GIS software? A CSV or Comma Separated Value file, is a text file in which separate fields are delimited by commas. This type of file can be used to store simple tabular data efficiently, minimizing file size. CSV files are easily opened with DB administration software such as PostgreSQL or MS Access, or by spreadsheet software such as MS Excel. This type of file can also be used to easily plot point data on desktop GIS software, given, as the active fire data does, that the tabular data contain X and Y coordinate information. The active fire data contains latitude and longitude location coordinates and the attributes of the detected fires. FIRMS US/Canada Why was FIRMS US/Canada developed? FIRMS US/Canada is the result of an agreement between the U.S. Forest Service and NASA to modernize the Forest Service's distribution of active fire information by leveraging the LANCE's web-based active fire mapping tools and capabilities for disseminating data, products and services. The significance of this NASA-Forest Service partnership goes beyond the creation of FIRMS US/Canada. It establishes a single, authoritative source of near real-time fire mapping, visualization, and geospatial data products and information for the United States and Canada jointly supported and enabled by both agencies. This enhanced cooperation will boost the availability of selected contextual geospatial data to increase the utility of near real-time fire geospatial data products, as well as increase opportunities, under the auspices of LANCE, to evaluate and integrate additional sources of NASA, NOAA, and international space agency satellite data of value to the user community. What active fire data and imagery are available in FIRMS US/Canada? *Other data and imagery sources are available for global coverage. See the FIRMS Global table .

What specific areas are covered by FIRMS US/Canada? FIRMS US/Canada includes coverage for the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Due to the geographic extent of these areas of interest, Mexico and Caribbean countries are also included. What are the differences between FIRMS Global and FIRMS US/Canada? Just like FIRMS, FIRMS US/Canada provides active fire data generally within 3 hours of a satellite observation from MODIS aboard NASA’s Aqua and Terra satellites and VIIRS aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites. Imagery is typically available within 3 to 4 hours and can be viewed on the interactive Fire Map application. In addition, FIRMS US/Canada meets the new Forest Service requirements by offering additional contextual layers and enhancements, including classifying fires to show time since detection to depict active fire fronts, incident locations and other information for current large fires in the US and Canada. FIRMS US/Canada provides current and historical corrected reflectance imagery from NASA and NOAA satellites, U.S. and Canada administrative ownership boundaries, daily fire danger forecasts, and current National Weather Service fire weather watch and red flag warning areas. What is the source for the USA Active Fires layer and what information does it provide? The USA Active Fires layer is based on information from the Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information (IRWIN) service maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior Office of Wildland Fire. IRWIN harvests and integrates information from numerous federal, state, and local wildfire reporting systems in near real-time to provide a single source of current information about all reported wildfire incidents. The USA Active Fires layer displays the location of current wildfires greater than 100 acres (40 hectares) in size and selected descriptive information, including fire name, latest reported size, and date/time of ignition. The displayed wildfire location is typically based on the identified or assumed point of origin of the fire. What is the source of the Canada Active Fires layer and what information does it provide? The Canada Active Fires layer is based on information from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System Active Wildfires dataset coordinated and maintained by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC) and Natural Resources Canada . Reported wildfire locations are updated and provided daily by partner provincial and territorial fire management agencies and Parks Canada. The Canada Active Fires layer displays the location of current wildfires greater than 100 acres (40 hectares) in size and selected descriptive information, including fire name/ID, latest reported size, and date/time of ignition. Where can I get more information about current wildfires in the U.S. and Canada? Additional information about current large wildfires in the United States can be found in the Incident Management Situation Report published by the National Interagency Coordination Center . Additional information about current large wildfires in Canada can be found in the National Fire Situation Report published by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC) . What is the source for USA Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings and what do they mean? The National Weather Service (NWS) is the source for fire weather watches and red flag warnings. A fire weather watch or red flag warning is issued by local/regional NWS forecast offices when the combination of dry fuels and weather conditions in designated NWS fire weather zones support extreme fire danger. Criteria for fire weather watches and red flag warnings vary by NWS office, but are typically based on the presence of fuel characteristics favorable for large fire growth, as determined by the land management agencies, and NWS-established critical thresholds for temperature, sustained winds, and relative humidity. Fire weather watches are issued up to 72 hours before these conditions are expected to occur while red flag warnings are issued when these conditions are expected to occur or are occurring within the next 24 hours. A similar layer for Canada is currently not available. What is the source for the USA Forecasted Fire Danger layer and what information does it provide? The Forecasted Fire Danger layer is based on the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS), which produces several components and indexes (e.g., ignition probability, fire rate of spread, etc.) that collectively describe current and potential fire danger conditions. Daily forecasted fire danger updates are used by wildland fire management agencies to assess current fire danger at local and national levels and inform decisions on an area’s fire protection needs. NFDRS fire danger is expressed as an adjective class rating that normalizes rating classes across different fuel models, indexes, and station locations. What is the source for the Canada Forecasted Fire Danger layer and what information does it provide? The Canada Fire Danger forecast layer is a relative index of how easy it is to ignite vegetation, how difficult a fire may be to control, and how much damage a fire may do. These ratings, updated and mapped daily, are based on the effects of fuel moisture and weather conditions on fire behavior as determined by the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System . Fire danger conditions are classified by the provincial and territorial fire management agencies and the choice and interpretation of classes may vary between provinces. What is the source for the United States wildfire perimeters and what does it display? The US Fire Perimeter layer displays the extent of current wildfires based on perimeter data from National Incident Feature Service (NIFS) maintained by the National Interagency Fire Center. Incident management teams for individual wildfire incidents are the source for these data. Input data/information sources for routine perimeter updates conducted by incident management teams, as well as the update frequency, can vary. How do I interpret/use wildfire perimeter data in the context of satellite active fire detection data? Wildfire perimeters for individual fires are typically updated once daily using relatively large scale data (airborne infrared flights, airborne or terrestrial GPS, etc.), but may be updated more or less frequently in particular circumstances. MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data introduce additional factors that can contribute spatial and temporal alignment between these data and perimeters for ongoing wildfire incidents. These factors include: Timing of satellite observations: MODIS and VIIRS are onboard polar-orbiting satellite platforms that do not provide persistent observations. They only detect the location and extent of active fires at the time of a satellite overpass. This may result in gaps in active fire detection data within perimeters. Properties of fire activity and active fire detection data resolution: The size and intensity of fires at the time of a satellite overpass, including small, very hot fires and larger, smoldering fires, can both trigger fire detection algorithms. In both conditions, the detected fire activity will be indicated at the spatial resolution of the thermal bands (375 m for VIIRS and 1 km for MODIS). In other words, a small, intense fire occupying a fraction of the pixel or a broader, cooler-burning fire occupying most of the pixel will both be represented as a fire at the spatial resolution of the data. This typically results in cumulative active fire detection data overestimating the size of a wildfire and not aligning with the perimeter boundaries. Satellite observation conditions: Atmospheric conditions, including clouds and heavy smoke, can partially or fully obscure fire activity at the time of a satellite overpass and hinder its detection. This omission of potentially detected fire activity can result in gaps in active fire detection data within perimeters. Additionally, the view geometry becomes more distorted with increasing distance from the nadir of the satellite observation. As a result, active fire detections in pixels towards the outer edges of the satellite view swath will be shifted/displaced outwards and fall outside the wildfire perimeter. Are additional capabilities planned for FIRMS US/Canada? Yes. The beta release of FIRMS US/Canada was completed in January 2021. Ongoing development activities include introduction of more remote sensing layers in the fire map viewer, particularly additional sources of near real-time satellite imagery and fire-relevant science data products, and enhancements to data downloads and user-defined fire alerts. More about the Ultra Real-Time (URT) and Real-Time (RT) data in FIRMS Ultra Real-Time (URT) MODIS and VIIRS active fire detections are available for the US and Canada. These data are compiled from multiple direct readout ground stations in CONUS as part of a partnership with Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. MODIS and VIIRS micro granules collected via direct broadcast are processed in seconds and made available in FIRMS in a matter of 1-2 minutes of satellite observation. The attributes of these URT data have a \"version\" ending in URT. (To obtain the attributes, zoom in and click on a fire in FIRMS Map viewer). Real-Time (RT) MODIS active fire detections are available through Direct Broadcast stations that process the data after the overpass has occurred. These data are generally available in FIRMS 20-25 minutes after satellite observation. See the Questions about Real-Time (RT) and Ultra Real-Time (URT) active fire data section for more information. Additional direct readout ground stations are being incrementally added to FIRMS. These additions will further increase the availability of URT MODIS and VIIRS data for North America collected from Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP and NOAA-20.

Along with their destructive power, they also are a vital component of forest growth, ecological succession, and soil nutrient enhancement. NASA provides datasets and tools for assessing and managing wildfires before, during, and after an event. Image Wildfires emitted 1.76 billion metric tonnes (equivalent to more than 1.9 billion tons) of carbon globally in 2021, according to data from the European Union's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Credit: U.S. Forest Service. Wildfires are an essential process connecting terrestrial systems to the atmosphere and climate, and are an integral component of ecological succession, plant germination, and soil enhancement. Along with these beneficial aspects, they also emit vast quantities of carbon into the atmosphere along with aerosols and other particles that can impact health, restrict visibility, and contribute to global climate change. This Data Pathfinder is designed to help guide you through the process of selecting and using datasets applicable to wildfires, with guidance on resolutions and direct links to the data sources. If you are new to remote sensing, the What is Remote Sensing? Backgrounder provides a good overview. In addition, NASA's Applied Remote Sensing Training Program (ARSET) provides numerous training modules, including Fundamentals of Remote Sensing . If you have specific questions about how to use data, tools, or resources mentioned in this Data Pathfinder, please visit the Earthdata Forum . Here, you can interact with other data users and NASA subject matter experts on a variety of Earth science research and applications topics. An Overview of Wildfire The number, severity, and overall size of wildfires has increased , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, through contributing factors including extended drought, the build-up of fuels, past fire management strategies, invasive species targeting specific tree species, and the spread of residential communities into formerly natural areas. In 2021, 58,985 wildfires were reported across the U.S. that consumed 7,125,643 acres , according to the 2021 Annual Report by the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC), which coordinates the mobilization of resources for wildland fire and other incidents throughout the U.S. But wildfires also have a human component. The NICC report notes that wildfires destroyed almost 6,000 structures in 2021, including 3,577 residences, 2,225 minor structures, and 237 commercial or mixed residential structures. Data collected by sensors aboard orbiting satellites, carried aboard aircraft, or installed on the ground provide a wealth of data that can be used to assess conditions before a burn, track the movement of a wildfire in near real-time, and assess the environmental impact of an historic burn. NASA provides numerous datasets, tools, and other resources that can be used to investigate, track, and assess wildfires, all of which are available without restriction under NASA's open data policy. Common Measurements at a Glance Datasets referenced in this Data Pathfinder are from sensors shown in the table below and is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all sensors or missions producing data relevant to wildfires. Some of these datasets are available through NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ). LANCE data products are available generally within three hours of a satellite observation, which allows for near real-time (NRT) monitoring and decision making. If low-latency is not a primary concern, users are encouraged to use standard science products, which are produced using the best available calibration, ancillary, and ephemeris information.

Fire Forecasting Many factors contribute to the intensity and spread of a fire, including vegetation health, precipitation, etc. Post-Fire Impacts Once a fire burns through an area, there are many potential impacts, such as loss of vegetation, landslide potential, runoff, and more. Connection of Sustainable Development Goals to Wildfires The Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a blueprint for a sustainable future for all of Earth’s inhabitants. The SDGs are part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , an international plan signed by all United Nations (UN) member states in 2015 and underpinned by the foundational components of People, Planet, and Prosperity. The 17 SDGs in the Agenda are made up of 169 objectives that include specific social, economic, and environmental targets. These targets provide a blueprint for developing a more sustainable global future. Data acquired remotely by sensors aboard satellites and aircraft or installed on the ground play a unique role in tracking the progress toward achieving the SDGs. These remotely sensed Earth observations provide consistent and continuous information on the state of Earth processes and their change over time. These data also are integral components of socioeconomic metrics that provide a measure of how humans co-exist with the environment and the stresses they encounter through natural and human-caused changes to the environment. NASA Earth observation data are available without restriction to all data users, a policy that is being adopted by other international space agencies and one that reduces the cost of monitoring the SDGs and provides developing countries a means to acquire and utilize these data for other policy-making purposes. NASA’s datasets are organized by topics that help users to locate, access, and apply relevant and complementary datasets for each SDG. The Wildfire Data Pathfinder addresses (but is not limited to) the following SDGs: SDG SDG Goals Relevant to Wildfires Image Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere Target 1.5: By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters Image Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture Target 2.4: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production; that help maintain ecosystems; that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding, and other disasters; and that progressively improve land and soil quality Image Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable Target 11.5: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations Image Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries Target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning Target 13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning The opportunities to connect NASA data to the SDGs are infinite; therefore, the datasets included in specific Data Pathfinders are not intended to be comprehensive. Additionally, NASA datasets are not official indicators for SDG monitoring and decision-making but are complementary.

Back to top of Tools section Sentinel Toolbox The ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-1 Mission consists of two satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments operating at a C-Band frequency. The satellites orbit 180° apart, and together image the entire Earth every six days. SAR is an active sensor that can penetrate cloud cover and vegetation canopy, and also observe at night. Therefore, it is ideal for flood inundation mapping. It also provides useful information to detect changes in land position after an earthquake, volcanic eruption, or landslide. SAR data are very complex to process; however, ESA has developed a Sentinel-1 Toolbox to aid with processing and analysis of Sentinel-1 data. For more information on active sensors like SAR, see What is Remote Sensing? ; for more information about SAR specifically, see What is SAR? . Flood Inundation Mapping Image Effects of the SAR band on penetration of surfaces. The longer the wavelength, the deeper the penetration through most land types. Credit: The SAR Handbook , Dr. Franz Meyer. Before choosing data, it's important to determine which SAR wavelength band meets your needs, as radar signals penetrate deeper as the sensor wavelength increases. This difference in penetration is due to the dielectric properties of a given medium, which dictate how much of the incoming radiation scatters at the surface, how much signal penetrates into the medium, and how much energy gets lost to the medium through absorption. Another important parameter to consider when choosing a SAR dataset is the polarization, or the direction in which the signal is transmitted or received: horizontally or vertically. Dual polarization, for example, refers to two different signal directions: horizontal/vertical and vertical/horizontal (HV and VH). Knowing the polarization from which a SAR image was acquired is important, as signals at different polarizations interact differently with objects on the ground and affect the recorded radar brightness in a specific polarization channel. Image Strong scattering in HH indicates a predominance of double-bounce scattering (e.g., stemmy vegetation, manmade structures), while strong VV relates to rough surface scattering (e.g., bare ground, water), and spatial variations in dual polarization indicate the distribution of volume scatterers (e.g., vegetation and high-penetration soil types such as sand or other dry porous soils). Credit: The SAR Handbook , Dr. Franz Meyer. Once you have downloaded the needed SAR data, the data must be calibrated to account for distortion. The objective in performing calibration is to create an image where the value of each pixel is directly related to the backscatter of the surface. Calibration takes into account radiometric distortion, signal loss as the wave propagates, saturation, and speckle. This process is critical for analyzing images quantitatively; it is also important for comparing images from different sensors, modalities, processors, and acquisition dates. Important note: DO NOT unzip the downloaded SAR file . Open the .zip file from within the Sentinel Toolbox. When you expand the Bands folder, you will see an amplitude and an intensity file for each polarization option. (The intensity band is a virtual one and is the square of the amplitude.) Open the amplitude file. Subset the data by zooming in to the area of interest and right-clicking on \"Spatial Subset from View.\" Calibration is done by following these steps: Radiometric calibration is performed by selecting Radar/Radiometric/Calibration (leave parameters as default). Geometric correction is done after radiometric calibration. This fixes geometric distortions due to slant range, layover, shadow, and foreshortening. Terrain correction can be performed by selecting Radar/Geometric/Terrain Correction/ Range-Doppler Terrain Correction. This requires a digital elevation model (within the processing parameters, SRTM is the default selection). You also can specify a map projection in the processing parameters. Speckle is another characteristic of SAR images that must be addressed. Speckle is the grey level variation that occurs between adjacent resolution cells, and creates a grainy texture. Within the Toolbox, speckle can be removed by selecting \"Radar/Speckle Filtering/Single Product Speckle Filter\" and then choosing a type of filter; \"Lee\" is one of the most common.

RAPT provides a number of resources for users to get familiar with using the tool: StoryMap User Guide Data Layers and Sources How-To Videos Back to top of Tools section Benefits and Limitations of Remote Sensing Data In determining whether or not to use remote sensing data, it is important to understand not only the benefits but also the limitations of these data. The U.S. is fortunate to have numerous ground-based measurements for assessing a wide range of environmental variables, including water storage, precipitation, particulate matter, and more. However, this is not the case in other countries—and even in some of the more remote areas of the U.S. Data acquired by sensors aboard satellites provide local, regional, and global coverage and are useful for observing areas that are inaccessible. Rapid processing of raw satellite data also enable events to be monitored in near-real time, allowing for a faster response. It is difficult for a single sensor to combine all desirable features into one instrument, and trade-offs are made by instrument designers. For example, to acquire observations with moderate to high spatial resolution (like the Operational Land Imager [OLI] aboard Landsat 8 or the OLI-2 aboard Landsat 9), a narrower swath is required. This, in turn, requires more time between observations of a given area. Finding a sensor with the spatio-temporal resolution capable of addressing your research, application, or decision-making needs is a crucial first step in using remotely sensed data. Passive instruments (those that use energy reflected or emitted from Earth for measurements) are not able to penetrate cloud or vegetation cover, which can lead to data gaps or a decrease in data utility, such as the inability to detect a fire or sense the radiative power of small fires. This is not the case when using data from active sensors, which send out a signal and measure the intensity of the returned signal. With satellite data, comparisons can be made using pre-event and post-event imagery, providing information on smoke and ash transport, burn severity, vegetation loss, and more. Incorporating satellite data with in-situ data (ground-based measurements) into modeling programs makes for an even more robust forecasting system.

Smith Oct 27, 2022 Image This screen capture from FIRMS shows Landsat active fire imagery of the Double Creek Fire in Oregon on September 10, 2022. The Landsat Active Fire and Thermal Anomalies product is generated from the Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI). The 30 m Landsat OLI fire data complement the VIIRS and MODIS fire detections, providing spatially explicit information for active fire fronts and scattered isolated fires within large fire perimeters. Credit: NASA LANCE. NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ) was developed in 2007 to provide near real-time active fire data to natural resource managers generally within three hours of satellite observation. Since its inception, the majority of these data have come from two instruments: the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) aboard the joint NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) and NOAA-20 satellites. The importance of MODIS and VIIRS to the detection and monitoring of wildland fire is due in large part to the frequency of their observations. The MODIS instruments aboard Terra and Aqua and the VIIRS instruments aboard Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 view the entirety of Earth’s surface every 1 to 2 days. These repeated and timely observations provide wildfire response teams and natural resource managers with a wealth of data they can use to detect new fires, track the growth of known fires in near real-time, and assess the impacts of large burns. However, in the context of satellite remote sensing, there is an inverse relationship between temporal resolution (or revisit time) and spatial resolution; meaning that what is gained in temporal resolution is lost in spatial resolution, and vice versa . Neither MODIS nor VIIRS are exempt from this relationship. Therefore, although MODIS and VIIRS offer impressive temporal resolution, their spatial resolution—1 kilometer for MODIS and 375 meters for VIIRS—is considered rather coarse by most standards. To address this trade-off, FIRMS recently added a new near real-time Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomalies ( LFTA ) product for continental U.S., the southern half of Canada, and the northern half of Mexico that offers high-resolution, 30-meter active fire detection data within 30 to 60 minutes of observation. \"Users value higher spatial resolution data. They really gravitated to the VIIRS 375-meter near real-time active fire data relative to MODIS because of its higher spatial fidelity, while still providing comprehensive coverage and multiple revisits on a daily basis,” said Brad Quayle, Remote Sensing and GIS specialist with the USDA Forest Service's Geospatial Technology and Applications Center ( GTAC ). “Although Landsat does not provide the comprehensive daily coverage of MODIS or VIIRS, its spatial fidelity is a tremendous improvement and provides the ability to detect and more precisely locate fire activity, at least for the areas imaged on a given day.” Dr. Morgan Crowley, Fire Research Scientist with Canadian Forest Service's WildFireSat Mission , agrees and calls the addition of Landsat active fire data in FIRMS “exciting,” as it increases FIRMS’ utility to the fire science community. Image An artist’s rendition of the Landsat 9 satellite in orbit. The LFTA product is based on multispectral imagery acquired by the Operational Land Imagers ( OLI ) aboard the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites. The OLI’s 30-meter resolution provides active fire detection data with 1,000 and 160 times finer spatial resolution than MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. Credit: USGS. “Landsat active fire hotspots provide fine spatial scale information that is useful for contextualizing sub-daily observations from the other products like MODIS, VIIRS, and Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel (HLS),” she said. “Additionally, there is now a greater opportunity to combine the fine spatial scale hotspots from Landsat with the fine temporal scale hotspots from the existing sources using one seamless pipeline when accessing data in FIRMS.” The LFTA product is based on multispectral imagery acquired by the Operational Land Imagers ( OLI ) aboard the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites. The OLI’s 30-meter resolution provides active fire detection data with 1,000 and 160 times finer spatial resolution than MODIS and VIIRS, respectively, and its enhanced capabilities allow it to detect active fires as small as approximately four-square meters during the day. Nighttime detection of similar fire activity, when available, improves to an area as small as 1-square meter. “The resolution of MODIS and VIIRS bands used for fire detection are relatively coarse and a fire detection can be triggered by a relatively small, intensely burning and isolated fire within the pixel or from a fire burning more broadly across the extent of the pixel,” Quayle said. “The spatial fidelity of Landsat active fire detection data and its use in the context of MODIS and VIIRS allow users to not only validate those coarser resolution detections, but more precisely locate fire activity, such as the smaller, isolated, but intense fires that cannot be reliably discerned from coarser resolution imagery and derived data.” Such improvement in the ability to pinpoint ignitions is of significant benefit to fire managers. “FIRMS is useful for active fire monitoring as it provides hotspot data in an easy-to-use platform in a rapid operational timeline,” Crowley said. “Having Landsat data now available means that fire managers will have access to more detailed hotspot points which could be useful for looking at fire lines, nighttime burning, and small-scale ignitions and fires.” Further, the LFTA product’s low latency means that these Landsat data are available to users much sooner than the HLS data products provided through FIRMS, which require approximately two days of processing after acquisition. “The LFTA product is currently provided for most of North America in near real-time, within 30 to 60 minutes after satellite overpass,” Quayle said. \"Having these data available at this low latency thanks to the support of the NASA and USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Data Center greatly increases their value to the user community.” With the OLI aboard both Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, approximately 15% of the continental U.S. is imaged on a daily basis. That may not sound like much, but Quayle says it is enough to provide somewhat significant coverage for strategic fire monitoring purposes. “When it images ongoing incidents on a given day, the LFTA product is going to be a helpful resource,” he said. Quayle acknowledges that having Landsat active fire detection data captured at the temporal resolution and geospatial coverage provided by MODIS and VIIRS would be ideal. Landsat satellites do not provide such comprehensive global coverage on a daily basis because, unlike VIIRS and MODIS, OLI has a much narrower swath width of 185 kilometers, so it requires 16 days to completely image Earth's surface. The relatively large swath widths of MODIS and VIIRS allow them to provide comprehensive satellite observations and acquire active fire detection data for the entire globe each day. So, OLI can only provide partial coverage of large geographic areas. However, since the orbits of the Landsat 8 ad 9 satellites are 8 days out of phase, the revisit time for a particular location is every 8 days. Users can determine the time and location of Landsat observations for a selected date by consulting the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 orbit tracks on the FIRMS fire maps. Image This graphic provides an example of a 185 km Landsat 9 OLI swath (red) compared to a 2,330 km Terra MODIS swath (orange). Terra MODIS can easily image the entire continental U.S. daily in three consecutive orbits. However, Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI each require multiple orbits over 16 days to provide the same coverage. Credit: NASA LANCE. Quayle also noted that the temporal resolution of routine daytime Landsat observations may be improved by requesting that the USGS’s Earth Resources Observation and Science ( EROS ) Center arrange nighttime OLI imagery collections for targeted areas when it can feasibly be done within the confines of current Landsat science and mission priorities. “This can potentially improve the temporal resolution of the Landsat active fire product to about four days for particular incidents,” Quayle said. “There is also the potential to use additional satellite sensors with spatial and spectral resolution similar to Landsat's OLI, but relatively better temporal resolution. Use of the combined observations of Landsat OLI and these other sensors could reduce the temporal resolution to as little as 1-2 days.” Expanding the extent of the operational NRT LFTA product, which, as noted earlier, is currently limited to the continental U.S., the southern half of Canada, and the northern half of Mexico, is more of a challenge. “Currently, the extent of the operational near real-time product is limited to the area of Landsat direct broadcast data collection coverage provided by the Landsat Ground Station EROS, which is located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota,” Quayle said. “This covers all of the continental U.S., the southern half of Canada, and the northern half of Mexico. To expand near real-time Landsat active fire detection coverage to other areas of the globe will require investment of time and resources to implement similar operational data streams at other Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 ground stations.” Nevertheless, the feasibility of including additional ground stations for North America and elsewhere is currently being investigated. The LFTA product is collaboratively produced by NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ), the University of Maryland , the U.S. Forest Service, and EROS. It was created at the request of NASA and the U.S. Forest Service, who asked EROS to develop a near real-time data processing framework that provides Level 1 terrain-corrected Landsat OLI imagery, which is then processed further with NASA science data algorithms to generate the Level-2 30-meter resolution active fire data product. This methodology produces the data that are imported directly into FIRMS and negates the need for NASA and the U.S. Forest Service to download numerous scenes of Landsat data for subsequent staging and processing. “We coordinated with the Landsat Team at EROS to discuss possibilities about the availability of low latency Landsat OLI imagery,” said Quayle. “They have been very accommodating to our request and developed an optimized near real-time processing stream to provide terrain corrected OLI imagery about 30 minutes after an overpass.” Currently, the Landsat active fire data reach back to June 2022. Although the processing of earlier acquisitions by Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 is possible, Quayle said there are no plans to provide them in FIRMS at this time. Users should be aware that the LFTA product lacks fire characterization information, such as estimates of a fire’s radiative power or heat energy, and that each hotspot/active fire detection represents the center of a 30-m pixel containing one or more fires or other thermal anomalies. Therefore, the location provided for each detection is the center point of the pixel and not necessarily the coordinates of the actual fire. Despite these limitations and its 8-day revisit time, this low latency product gives operational fire managers and fire scientists quicker access to more precise, higher-resolution data. “For active fire management purposes, the more timely the data, the greater its value. Yes, the temporal resolution is currently the greatest limitation, but until now, the bigger limitation in the operational use of the Landsat active fire data product was its latency—the availability of the source Landsat OLI imagery after satellite observation,” Quayle said. “Without the partnership and substantial contributions of EROS, the operational availability and potential value of this product would never be realized.” About FIRMS FIRMS was developed in 2007 by the University of Maryland, with funds from NASA’s Applied Sciences Program and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO ), to provide near real-time active fire locations to natural resource managers that faced challenges obtaining timely satellite-derived fire information. FIRMS US/Canada, which launched in January 2021, was developed through an agreement between the U.S. Forest Service's GTAC and NASA to modernize and optimize the U.S. Forest Service's distribution of active fire information by leveraging LANCE's web-based active fire mapping tools and capabilities for disseminating data, products, and services. Like the original FIRMS, FIRMS US/Canada provides active fire imagery that can be viewed on an interactive fire map and current and historical corrected reflectance imagery from NASA and NOAA satellites. It also meets recently developed U.S. Forest Service requirements by offering additional contextual layers and enhancements, including the depiction of active fire fronts complete with time-since-detection information, incident locations, ownership boundaries for current large fires in the U.S. and Canada, and National Weather Service fire weather forecasts and red flag warning areas.

Sources for these additional data include the National Interagency Fire Center, Department of the Interior Office of Wildland Fire, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, Canadian Interagency Fire Centre, and Natural Resources Canada FIRMS US/Canada builds on a longstanding partnership between NASA and the Forest Service. In 2001, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, (GSFC) and the University of Maryland (UMD) developed the MODIS Land Rapid Response System to provide time-critical, science grade data products to the Forest Service and other users. That same year, the Forest Service implemented the Active Fire Mapping (AFM) Program to ingest near real-time data from the, now decommissioned, MODIS Land Rapid Response System to produce and disseminate value-added geospatial fire products. AFM since evolved to leverage and ingest MODIS and VIIRS satellite direct readout data and the NASA LANCE MODIS/VIIRS data stream. FIRMS US/Canada is a joint NASA/Forest Service effort to modernize and optimize the legacy AFM Program data and product delivery capabilities that have provided imagery and geospatial fire products for the United States and Canada since 2001. The initial release of FIRMS US/Canada was launched in January 2021 and provides an updated platform for delivery of near real-time satellite data products as well as mapping and visualization capabilities. Data from additional near real-time satellite sources and other technical capabilities are also planned for the FIRMS US/Canada application after the initial early-2021 release.

Note: RT and URT data roll off the system after six hours as NRT data become available. Credit: FIRMS. When it comes to monitoring and fighting wildfires, accurate and timely data about a fire’s location, extent, intensity, and impact are critical. That’s why NASA funded the Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ) in 2007 and, more recently, partnered with the U.S. Forest Service to develop FIRMS US/Canada , a new instance of FIRMS that optimizes the Forest Service's distribution of active fire information by leveraging LANCE's web-based active fire mapping tools and capabilities for disseminating data, products, and services. Now, FIRMS has announced the release of ultra real-time (URT) data, which provide active fire data in seconds and make FIRMS’s value to the wildland fire community even greater. “[This] is the first routine service for detecting wildfires over the continental United States from NASA and NOAA low-Earth orbit satellites with a latency of less than 60 seconds from Earth observation to wildfire detection,” said Liam Gumley, a scientist with the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Space Science and Engineering Center ( SSEC ). URT data are made possible by an SSEC-developed system that receives, decodes, and processes data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) instrument aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership and NOAA-20 satellites to produce active fire data for the continental United States (CONUS) within 60 seconds using direct broadcast. The system capitalizes on SSEC’s access to direct broadcast antennas throughout the continental United States, as well as Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Software systems enable the SSEC to stream the direct broadcast data in real-time from each antenna to a central collection point at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, which then ingests, merges, and de-duplicates the data in real-time. The software is set up to process micro-granules from Level 0 through Level 1 to active fire Level 2 products using the same version of the thermal anomalies/fire code (i.e., the contextual fire algorithm code) that LANCE uses. The active fire data are then converted to Comma Separated Values (CSV) format and provided to FIRMS via a web-based application programming interface (API). The result is MODIS wildfire detections with a latency of approximately 25 seconds and VIIRS wildfire detections with a latency of approximately 50 seconds (relative to time of observation on the spacecraft).

According to Brad Quayle, a remote sensing and GIS specialist with the Forest Service's Geospatial Technology and Applications Center ( GTAC ), the fire data in FIRMS are being identified as URT so users can distinguish them from the near real-time MODIS and VIIRS data in FIRMS that are provided by the LANCE data stream. NASA and the Forest Service have been planning for the implementation of real-time MODIS and VIIRS data into FIRMS applications, and both were impressed with the system the SSEC developed, so NASA began coordinating with the SSEC to incorporate the URT data into FIRMS. The initial funding for integrating the URT active fire data into FIRMS is from the NASA Applied Sciences Program Wildland Fires program area and the agency-wide FireSense initiative. “The system significantly reduces the amount of time to process and access direct readout data compared to traditional processing workflow methods,” Quayle said. “The data are processed and available in seconds, as the satellite overpass is occurring, versus being available 15-20 minutes after the overpass has occurred.” The ability to access such low-latency data is of immense value to the wildfire community. “The more timely the data, the higher their value when assessing the location, extent, and intensity of newly detected fire activity,” said Quayle. “This timeliness also increases their potential for use as a tool to detect new fire starts. Having these data in FIRMS within a minute of a satellite overpass will help us identify where new starts may be occurring, particularly in remote, less populated areas.” There are, however, some limitations with URT data, including the possibility of technical issues associated with the use of direct readout antennas. “Terra’s direct broadcast signal uses the same frequency as the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN), so when the DSN is active out of Goldstone, California, the direct broadcast from Terra is temporarily halted for very short periods of time (typically less than a minute),” he said. “During those periods, no Terra MODIS direct readout data are received and there is a gap in the data for that very short period.” There may also be occasional issues with particular ground stations that may happen to be temporarily offline due to technical issues, but such instances are “relatively rare,” said Quayle. Fortunately, ground station coverage typically overlaps, which helps minimize any potential data gaps. Further, any data gaps that might occur will be filled with NRT MODIS and VIIRS data from LANCE, albeit with a longer latency. Quayle and Gumley also acknowledged that, although the MODIS and VIIRS instruments aboard Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, and NOAA-20 are well suited for detecting fires from low-Earth orbit, they may miss some ignitions given the infrequency of their observations. Active fire data from geostationary satellites could help fill that gap. “There are tradeoffs between low-Earth orbit satellite observations versus geostationary observations,” said Gumley. “The low-Earth orbit sensors, such as VIIRS and MODIS, can detect smaller fires, but each satellite only flies over the CONUS 2 to 3 times in daylight and 2 to 3 times at night. Geostationary satellites provide CONUS data at 10-, 5-, or 1-minute intervals, so they can detect more wildfires. However, their ability to detect small wildfires is not as good as the sensors on the satellites in low-Earth orbit.” Quayle concurs. “Geostationary satellite sensors, such as the Advanced Baseline Imager aboard NOAA’s GOES-16 satellite, can potentially provide more frequent updates on changes in fire spread and between low-Earth orbit observations, but at a coarser resolution and with other technical considerations,” he said. NASA is already planning to add active fire data from geostationary satellites to FIRMS in the coming weeks. As these continued improvements to FIRMS suggest, NASA and the Forest Service endeavor to establish a single, authoritative source of near real-time fire mapping, visualization, and geospatial data products for the United States and Canada. This enhanced cooperation will not only increase the fire community’s use of near real-time fire geospatial data products, it will expand NASA’s opportunity, under the auspices of LANCE, to evaluate and integrate additional sources of NASA, NOAA, and international space agency satellite data of value to the user community.

In other words, as spatial resolution increases, temporal resolution decreases and vice versa. For example, the VIIRS sensor onboard S-NPP and NOAA-20 has a swath width of 3,000 kilometers and each instrument images the entire surface of the Earth at least once daily. The swath width of MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua is narrower at 2,330 km providing slightly less than daily global coverage. However, the finest spatial resolution of active fire detection data that can be gleaned from VIIRS and MODIS at 375 meters and 1 kilometer, respectively, are considered coarse resolution data by most definitions. In comparison to VIIRS and MODIS, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard both Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 provides active fire detections at relatively finer spatial resolution (30 meters) ( please see the related NASA FIRMS blog entry that introduces the Landsat active fire product ) . Unlike VIIRS and MODIS, OLI has a much narrower swath width of 185 kilometers. The swath of OLI is less than 1/10 th the width of a MODIS swath and provides much lower temporal resolution/sampling by comparison (Fig 1). Figure 1 - Example of a 185 km Landsat 9 OLI swath (red) compared to a 2,330 km Terra MODIS swath (orange). Terra MODIS can easily image the entire continental US daily in three consecutive orbits. However, Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI each require multiple orbits over 16 days to provide the same coverage. How do these characteristics affect the daily availability of active fire data? The relatively large swath widths of VIIRS and MODIS sensors provide comprehensive satellite observations and derived active fire detection data for the entire globe on a daily basis. Additionally, both sensors provide multiple observations daily within a relatively short period of time where consecutive swaths may overlap, more so at higher latitudes (Fig 2). Figure 2 - Example of MODIS and VIIRS orbit tracks showing overlap between tracks, especially at higher latitudes. Conversely, each Landsat OLI sensor requires 16 days to completely image the surface of the Earth. So, OLI cannot fully image large geographic areas in one day, such as the continental United States, and can only provide partial coverage. However, since the orbits of the two Landsat satellites are 8 days out of phase, the combined temporal resolution of the two OLI sensors enables complete coverage once every 8 days (Fig 3). Figure 3 – The top graphic provides an example of the swath coverage for the continental US by OLI onboard Landsat 8 (orange) and Landsat 9 (red) on July 13, 2022. Orbits for each satellite move to the east and west daily and complete a full cycle of coverage every 16 days. The bottom graphic displays the HLS imagery product in FIRMS for July 13, 2022, which contains the acquired Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 imagery over land. Areas along each swath that exceed the predetermined cloud cover threshold are excluded from HLS product in FIRMS. The combined daily coverage of OLI on both Landsat satellites can image the entire continental US, and the globe, every 8 days. When viewing daily active fire detection data in FIRMS, users should be aware of the high temporal resolution characteristics of VIIRS and MODIS versus Landsat. In Figure 4, active fires detected by Terra MODIS and Landsat on September 10, 2022, for the Pacific Northwest are provided. Landsat active fire detection data, displayed as yellow points, is only available within the 185-kilometer OLI swath. However, MODIS active fire detection data, displayed as red points, is available for the entire region within and outside of the OLI swath. Consequently, updates to the finer resolution Landsat active fire detection data for the entire Earth cannot be provided daily. Figure 4 - Active fires detected in the Pacific Northwest on September 10, 2022. 1 kilometer MODIS active fire detections (red) are available for the entire region while 30-meter Landsat 9 active fire detections (yellow) are limited to the 185-kilometer swath (WRS-2 Path 42) acquired on this date. New Near Real-Time Product in FIRMS – Landsat Active Fire Data Brad Quayle posted on Sep 29, 2022 Earlier this year, we highlighted the availability of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery in the FIRMS map viewers . This imagery, provided by NASA's IMPACT project , enables a relatively high spatial resolution perspective of fire activity and post-fire effects. Similar to MODIS and VIIRS, we are now providing active fire data in FIRMS, generated from Landsat observations. This new near real-time (NRT) Landsat Fire and Thermal Anomaly (LFTA) active fire product is the result of an ongoing collaboration by NASA LANCE/FIRMS, University of Maryland, USDA Forest Service and USGS EROS Data Center. The total elapsed time from satellite overpass to the availability of Landsat active fire detection data in FIRMS is 30 minutes or less. Users should note that these Landsat active fire detection data are provided much sooner than the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel (HLS) imagery products, that are dynamically generated, and currently available in FIRMS approximately 2 days after acquisition. Daily Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI data for CONUS and most of Canada and Mexico are collected via direct readout by USGS EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the request of NASA and the USDA Forest Service, USGS developed a near real-time data processing framework that provides Level 1 terrain corrected Landsat OLI imagery. This data is subsequently processed using NASA science data processing algorithms to generate Level 2 30 meter resolution active fire data. How does Landsat active fire data compare with MODIS and VIIRS active fire data? Landsat active fire data is more than 1,000 times more resolute than MODIS and more than 160 times more resolute than MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. The algorithm routinely detects fires as small as a few square meters, or smaller, providing spatially explicit detail of location and extent of fire activity at the time of satellite overpass. Active fire fronts, as well as scattered smaller fires within the fire perimeter are routinely detected. However, these relatively high spatial resolution data have a lower temporal resolution compared to the daily observation frequency afforded by MODIS and VIIRS. Between both Landsat OLI instruments, areas in the lower to mid latitudes are imaged every 8 days ( please see the related NASA FIRMS blog entry that describes the characteristics of different satellite sensors and their effects on the spatial extent of daily active fire data ). The temporal resolution of Landsat data can be increased though collection of nighttime Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 imagery for targeted areas when it can feasibly be done within the confines of current Landsat science and mission priorities. Viewing the LFTA in FIRMS The Landsat active fire data can be viewed in both FIRMS global and FIRMS US/Canada . The LFTA are displayed in Basic and Advanced Mode. To display the Landsat active fire detections by time since detection, select the \"Time Based\" option. To distinguish the Landsat active fire detections from other active fire detections (such as MODIS and VIIRS), select the \"Advanced Mode\" and \"Custom\" and select the \"+\" icon next to the fire detections you want to change. Select the drop down arrow to the right of the color and a color wheel will appear. Select a color and press apply. For more information see the FIRMS blog entry on How to customize the fires displayed in FIRMS A September 10, 2022 HLS Landsat 9 OLI false color composite image for the southern portion of the Double Creek Fire in northeast Oregon. In the top image, burned areas appear in dark red hues while both isolated and broadly burning areas appear bright orange-red. The bottom image highlights the 30-meter active fire detections (yellow) that correspond to actively burning areas. Users should note that Landsat active fire detection data is available in FIRMS in near real-time approximately 30 minutes after acquisition while corresponding Landsat imagery is generated dynamically and available in FIRMS 2-3 days after acquisition. New Enhancements Make Generating Imagery Subsets in Worldview Snapshots Even Easier Brad Quayle posted on Sep 11, 2022 The NASA Worldview Snapshots tool enables users to easily create satellite imagery subsets for anywhere in the world. The tool provides access to current and historical imagery captured by Terra and Aqua MODIS and S-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS. By simply selecting the desired image product, acquisition date, spatial resolution, output file type as well as entering the latitude/longitude bounding box, users can quickly generate an imagery subset to use for visualization in a GIS or as a graphic in a presentation or document. For the convenience of users who need to create satellite imagery subsets of geopolitical units, Snapshots has recently been enhanced to include predefined latitude/longitude bounding boxes for countries. After setting the basic parameters for an imagery subset, users can simply select their desired country of interest from the Countries dropdown list in Country/Region Presets box below the map. The red box that subsequently appears on the map indicates the bounding box of the subset to be generated. Users can also increase the default size of the subset boundary extent by 5% to 20% by selecting the desired 5% interval under the Padding dropdown list or manually edit the predefined coordinates as desired in the Bounding Box section of the interface. Users can also generate imagery subsets for a US state or Canadian province or territory. After selecting either of these two countries, a user can select the State / Province / Region dropdown list to update the subset bounding box extent to the targeted state, province or territory. A September 9, 2022 Aqua MODIS true color composite image for Oregon generated from NASA Worldview Snapshots. The subset bounding box is defined by the map extent of the state, predefined in Snapshots, and extended by an additional 5% in both dimensions. A screenshot of the Worldview Snapshots definition for an imagery subset of the state or Oregon. The updated interface enables users to select a country (as well as a US state and Canadian province/territory) and use its associated map extent as the bounding box coordinates for the subset boundary. If desired, users can increase the size of the predefined bounding box in 5% intervals or edit manually edit the coordinates. Landsat 9 Now Included in Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 Imagery Brad Quayle posted on Aug 23, 2022 Earlier this year, F IRMS integrated the Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 (HLS) Imagery product. This data stream has recently been enhanced with the integration of Landsat 9 data. Users can now integrate HLS True Color and False Color Composite Imagery from Landsat 9 in addition to Landsat 8. Both Landsat instruments image every location on the Earth's surface at least every 16 days and their respective orbits are 8 days out of phase. As a result, they provide 8 day repeat coverage of any area on the globe. With the two Landsat instruments and two Sentinel-2 instruments, the HLS data stream allows for 30 meter land surface observations every 2-3 days. HLS data services are made available by the NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT) and can be visualized in FIRMS map viewers approximately 2-4 days after acquisition. Please see the April 2022 FIRMS blog post for additional information on the HLS data product and how to access it in FIRMS. HLS false color composite image for the Moose Fire in northeast Idaho acquired by Landsat 8 on July 18, 2022 (top). The HLS false color image acquired on July 26, 2022 by Landsat 9 (bottom) illustrates the growth of the fire over that 8 day period. Note active fire areas in these images appear as glowing orange.

There are times when it is useful to be able to distinguish between instruments (MODIS/VIIRS) or day/night detections. To do this Select ADVANCED MODE in the Layer List on the right of the map (see image below) Select the \"+\" icon next to the fire detections you want to change. Select the drop down arrow to the right of the color and a color wheel will appear. Select a color and press apply. This step can be repeated for other fire detection categories. CHANGE FIRE PIXEL SIZE The fire pixel size defaults to the optimal display for the zoom level. When zoomed into the highest zoom levels , MODIS pixels maintain a size of approximately 1km and VIIRS approximately 375m To change the pixel size, make sure ADVANCED MODE is selected (as shown above). Click the \"+\" icon and then click the drop down arrow next to the word \"Auto\" Adjust the pixel size from the drop down list SHOW ONLY DAY / NIGHT FIRES By default, the map shows both Day time and night time fires, to view only day time fires, may sure ADVANCED MODE is selected (as shown above). Click the \"+\" icon then click on \"Night\" to deselect it and it is greyed out. To view only nighttime fires, click on \"Night\" to turn both back on and then click on \"Day\" so it is greyed out. VIEW FIRES BY FRP, CONFIDENCE or TIME SINCE DETECTION To view fires using Fire Radiative Power (FRP), Confidence or Time Since Detection, select \"ADVANCED MODE\" in the Layer List, then select the drop down arrow next to the word \"Fires\" for the fire detections you want to change. Time Since Detection shows the fires < 1, 1-3, 3-6, 6-12, 12-24, and >24 Hours since the fires were detected by the satellite. Enable this by selecting \"Time Based\" in either Basic or Advanced Mode. 2 Comments Wildfire detection in the US and Canada within a minute of satellite observation Diane Davies posted on Jul 14, 2022 FIRMS recently integrated ultra real-time (URT) MODIS and VIIRS active fire data, within a minute of satellite observation, from multiple direct readout ground stations in the continental US (CONUS). See \" FIRMS Adds Ultra Real-Time Data from MODIS and VIIRS \" article on Earthdata.nasa.gov This is the first routine service provided by FIRMS for detecting wildfires over the continental United States from NASA and NOAA low-Earth orbit satellites with a latency of less than 60 seconds from Earth observation to wildfire detection. The ultra real-time processing has been made possible by the Space Science and Engineering Center ( SSEC ) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison with funding from NASA's WildFireSense program. Software systems enable the SSEC to stream direct broadcast data in real-time from each antenna to a central collection point at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, which then ingests and merges the data, including de-duplication of overlapping data, in real-time. Currently URT data are received from Madison, Wisconsin (2 antennas), Hampton, Virginia and Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. In addition to the URT, Real-Time (RT) data are received from Honolulu, Hawaii and Monterey, California (after the pass is complete). Latency for RT data is 20—30 minutes. It is anticipated that the real-time data will be expanded to include additional CONUS stations and stations in Alaska and Hawaii. Figure showing current and planned coverage of Direct Broadcast stations collecting ultra real-time and real-time data URT and RT thermal anomaly / fire detections are processed using the LANCE FIRMS active fire algorithms, so the data are comparable with the NRT data from LANCE. URT and RT data are available in both FIRMS and FIRMS US/Canada Fire maps and can be identified by the URT or RT suffix in the \"version\" - found by clicking on the fires to view the attributes. URT and RT data are also available in the WMS and WFS map services and KMZs. URT and RT data will roll off the system within six hours as the NRT data becomes available. Screenshot showing URT fire detected on 2022/06/30. The f ire was observed at 12:17 CDT and displayed in FIRMS at 12:19 CDT (as shown by computer time on top right of screen) Users can see the real-time fire detections by selecting the Time Based option which color codes fires by Time Since Detection. However it is important to note that the URT and RT fires only show up within a minute of satellite fly-over so users need to know when the satellite passes overhead. To find our what time the satellite overpass is you can load the orbit tracks. (see next screenshot) Screenshot showing descending overpass times from Suomi-NPP, NOAA-20, Aqua and Terra. These can be added by going to Advanced Mode and then selecting tracks from the Orbit Tracks and Overpass Times. Once you have the Orbit tracks loaded, make sure the fires display using the \"Time-Based\" option and the look for the deep red colored squares. New - GeoTIFF from FIRMS Screenshot Diane Davies posted on Jul 13, 2022 FIRMS fire map users have always had the opportunity to compile a map view using desired layers and then capture a screenshot and save it as a JPG, PNG or GIF file to use or share. Users now have the option of capturing a FIRMS map view as a GeoTIFF image file. The GeoTIFF format includes spatial (georeferencing) information embedded in the .tif file so it can be integrated and viewed with other geospatial data. The GeoTIFF standard is in the public domain and can be readily imported and displayed in many GIS applications. To create a GeoTIFF, click on the \"screenshot\" icon from the lower right of the FIRMS user interface and select \"GeoTIFF\" from the dropdown option in the screenshot window. New - Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 Imagery (beta version) Diane Davies posted on Apr 18, 2022 In collaboration with NASA's IMPACT project , dynamic false color imagery is now available through FIRMS to help better delineate burned areas. A screenshot from FIRMS US/Canada displaying the Sentinel-2 Adjusted Reflectance Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) using bands 12-8a-4. It shows the Hermits Peak Fire in New Mexico, USA as captured on 3 May 2022. In this image, the burned areas appear in brick red and are overlain with active fire pixels from MODIS and VIIRS. ( Link to view in FIRMS ) FIRMS has recently integrated an additional Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 (HLS) Imagery product. The Reflectance (Bands 7-5-4) layer from Landsat 8/OLI and (Bands 12, 8a, 4) from Sentinel 2A and 2B are false color composite (FCC) images that allow us to visualize wavelengths that the human eye cannot see (i.e. short wave infrared and near infrared). Burned areas appear almost brick red making it easier to see fire affected areas and water is very dark, almost black, which makes it much easier to see lakes or flooded lands. Unlike other satellite imagery layers in FIRMS, which are provided through NASA GIBS , the beta version HLS False Color Composite Imagery (Bands 7-5-4 for Landsat and Bands 12, 8a, 4 for Sentinel 2A and 2B), are provided dynamically through the NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT) , as such it may take slightly longer to display than the HLS True Color imagery through GIBS. HLS imagery is currently available approximately 2 -4 days after acquisition. Steps to view the HLS FCC layers: The HLS layers are only available in Advanced Mode (basic mode has reduced functionality to minimize the complexity of the interface). • Go to https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/usfs/map/ or https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/ • Toggle the “Advanced Mode” button in the upper right . • Toggle the “Historical” button in the upper right. • The HLS Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery are in the “Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2” grouping in the table of contents. • Use the tools/prompts to access and view the imagery. • Toggle on the True Color imagery first to get a good idea of where the FCC data can be expected on a given day. Use the screenshot tool to create a GeoTIFF of the image to enable the image to be imported in to a GIS. Some things to note: • The HLS imagery is not near real-time data. It is currently available about 2 -4 days after acquisition. • The reach back on this service goes back to March 15, 2022. • As the FCC is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than the True Color imagery through GIBS. We are monitoring the performance of the HLS FCC imagery and welcome feedback. • Zoom scale to display the false color composite data is currently set to 11 through 14, but true color can be viewed at smaller scales. The zoom level is indicated at the very end of the URL (e.g., 11z). • Orbit tracks for Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A and 2B are available as layers in the table of contents. • Landsat 9 data is anticipated to be incorporated into the HLS product in late April. At that time, or soon thereafter, it will be part of the HLS service in FIRMS. Find out more about HLS New FIRMS Feature / Location Tool Diane Davies posted on Jan 11, 2022 FIRMS recently added a location tool to enable users to easily find and save places of interest. Open the Location Tool by clicking on the \"Location\" icon from the bottom menu of FIRMS Fire Map or the FIRMS US/Canada Fire Map . Enter the location or coordinates to search in the \"Find Location\" tab, c hecking the box to \"allow multiple location selection\". Click on the \"Current Location\" to find out what location you are viewing. Any locations you store for future visits will be saved under the \"Saved Locations\" tab. Basic and Advanced Modes for FIRMS Users Brad Quayle posted on Aug 24, 2021 Basic Mode FIRMS provides a comprehensive array of near real-time NASA Earth observations and derived science data products to detect the location and extent of fire activity and its effects on the land and atmosphere. FIRMS has recently implemented a scalable user interface to better meet the needs and use cases of various users. When initiating the fire map for either FIRMS Global or FIRMS US/Canada FIRMS, the user interface to the right of the map window defaults to BASIC MODE . In this mode, a focused list of commonly used layers is presented to the user for display. This list includes MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data, locations of current US and Canada large wildland fires, true color MODIS and VIIRS satellite imagery and particular background and overlay layers. By simply selecting the button, users can choose to toggle to ADVANCED MODE. In this mode, all available FIRMS layers are provided for users to access and display. This includes false color MODIS and VIIRS satellite imagery, MODIS and VIIRS land and atmosphere science data products, additional sources of satellite imagery, contextual layers for wildland fire management, and several overlay and background layers. As with other user-applied customizations to the fire map, when a bookmark is created, the map will retain the applied mode when you return to the map using that referenced bookmark. FIRMS is continuing to add relevant sources of Earth observation data and science data products. Please stay tuned as we continue to introduce these additional sources of data and associated tools and utilities. Advanced Mode Where’s the smoke coming from? Brad Quayle posted on Jul 15, 2021 Viewing smoke in FIRMS using corrected reflectance imagery Wildland fires can be a significant source of smoke that not only impairs our ability to enjoy clear vistas, but the gases and particulate matter it contains can be harmful to public health. When you see smoke in the sky it may be originating from a relatively local fire or a fire that is occurring several hundred miles away. True color composite imagery acquired by Terra MODIS, Aqua MODIS, S-NPP VIIRS or NOAA-20 VIIRS are provided as “Backgrounds” layers in FIRMS and FIRMS US/Canada Fire Maps. These layers display a \"natural color image\" of the Earth’s surface as it would look to the human eye from space. Consequently, it is easy to see smoke using this type of imagery in clear sky conditions. The time of observation for these four satellites occur at different times during the day, so they can be used to identify current sources of wildland fire smoke and visualize its transport across long distances. Use the Orbit Tracks and Overpass Times layers to determine the daily overpass time for each satellite. Viewing smoke in FIRMS using aerosol indices The standard Aerosol Index (AI) derived from S-NPP OMPS observations can also be used for identifying and tracking smoke as well as other aerosols. The OMPS Al, available as an “Overlays” layer in the FIRMS and FIRMS US/Canada Fire Maps, detects and measures the density of smoke and suspended particles in the vertical air column in the atmosphere. Typical values of the AI range from 0 to 5 and indicate dust storms or biomass burning smoke located in the lower troposphere (1-3 km). Values of 5.0 indicate heavy concentrations of aerosols that could reduce visibility or impact human health. For AI values significantly higher than 5 use the OMPS PyroCumuloNimbus, or pyroCb, AI layer. Larger pyroCb AI values between 5 and 10 usually indicate dense smoke from intensely burning fires that reach higher in the troposphere. Once the index gets above 10, the smoke has likely been produced from a pyroCb event, with dense smoke lofted into the upper troposphere and, often, into the stratosphere. Wildland fire smoke visible in S-NPP VIIRS true color imagery acquired on July 11, 2021 (top). Active fire detections are displayed as red points. The aerosol index derived from S-NPP OMPS observations collected at the same time as the VIIRS imagery is provided for comparison (bottom). The high index values over Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana indicate high concentrations of aerosols and are a result from fire activity in the Pacific Northwest and northern California. High aerosol index values in the eastern Dakotas, Minnesota and western Ontario are sourced from wildland fire activity in eastern Manitoba and western Ontario. Additional information about wildland fires in US and Canada Brad Quayle posted on Jul 08, 2021 Get information and zoom to extent of wildland fires The new FIRMS US/Canada fire map includes the location and details of wildland and prescribed fires. Locations of currently/recently active incidents larger than 100 acres (40.5 hectares) are displayed as fire icons when you open the US & Canada Fire Map. Click USA Active Fires and Canada Active Fires layers to toggle them off. Click on a fire location to view the name, discovery date/time and current size of the fire. This information is routinely updated and maintained in systems of record managed by US and Canadian wildland fire management agencies. Clicking the View Situation Report link spawns a national situation report which may contain specific reporting information about the fire of interest. Additionally, by clicking the ZOOM TO LOCATION button, your map extent will automatically zoom to the extent of that fire. Clicking on a fire location provides information about the fire and the option to zoom to the map extent of the selected fire. Perimeters for current US wildland fires For wildland fires currently occurring in the US larger than 100 acres in size, fire perimeters are provided for context. These data are typically compiled by federal, state and local fire management agencies on a routine basis during the life of an incident, however, they may not be available for all incidents. These data are typically updated daily from multiple sources and indicate the current extent of the fire and containment lines. Click on USA Fire Perimeter layer to display the fire perimeter data in the FIRMS US/Canada Fire Map. When using perimeters in the context of satellite active fire detection data, this can indicate where a fire is active within the perimeter and if it is growing outside of it. Additionally, if the fire perimeter is not fully covered by cumulative active fire detections, gaps in that coverage may indicate where the fire has grown in between observations by polar-orbiting satellite sensors like MODIS and VIIRS, cloud cover at the time of satellite overpass occluded observations when the fire was actively burning, or fire activity was smaller and/or less intense at the time of satellite overpass or was not detectable under the vegetation canopy. Isolated active fire detection pixels outside of the perimeter can be indicative of detections occuring towards the edge of a swath which results geolocational errors due to the increasingly distorted field of view in the scan track direction, particularly for MODIS. Visualization of MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data in the context of a current perimeter for a wildland fire. New FIRMS Feature/Capability Highlight Brad Quayle posted on Jun 30, 2021 The FIRMS team has introduced several new features and capabilities to both FIRMS Global and FIRMS US/Canada. We’ll continue to highlight these new additions over several future posts. In this post, we would like to highlight the Time Since Detection classification for MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data that is available in the fire map for FIRMS Global and FIRMS US/Canada. This classification symbolizes active fires based on their time of detection relative to the current time. This enables users to visualize recent fire progression and currently active fire fronts for wildland fires. The temporal classification displays active fire detections occurring in the past 0 to 6 hours (deep red), detections occurring 6 to 12 hours earlier (red) and 12 to 24 hours earlier (orange), and detections occurring previous to the last 24 hour period (yellow). Setting the Time Since Detection Classification in FIRMS Open the fire map viewer for FIRMS Global or FIRMS US/Canada Select the Time Since Detection choice from the pick list associated for a particular satellite/sensor source in the FIRMS display control window to apply this classification to the active fire detection data for that source layer To apply it for all the MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection layers, click the Time Based button at the top of in the FIRMS display control window Examples of active fire data displayed with the time since detection classification: Examples for setting the time since detection classification in FIRMS SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS active fire detection locations in Northern California symbolized by their time since detection at ~17:00 PDT June 30, 2021 SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS active fire detection locations in Western Ontario symbolized by their time since detection at ~19:00 CDT June 30, 2021 New Web Services added to FIRMS US/Canada and FIRMS Global Diane Davies posted on Jun 08, 2021 FIRMS has added additional capability to integrate satellite active fire detection data as streaming web services. Several new geospatial web services are now available to meet the needs of end users in visualizing and analyzing these data in the context of geospatial information in desktop or web mapping applications. New Web Map Services In addition to legacy FIRMS Web Map Services (WMS) that provide MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection data for the past 24, 48, 72 hours or the past 7 days, new services are provided that display these data relative to their time since detection. New WMS options enable visualization of cumulative MODIS and VIIRS active fire data for the current calendar year in two temporal classifications that depict the data in its relative time since detection. Please see the WMS information page for FIRMS US/Canada and FIRMS Global for service connection information and tutorials on how to access the services. Temporal classifications for the new MODIS and VIIRS active fire detection web map services available in FIRMS. New Web Feature Services FIRMS has also introduced new regional Web Feature Services (WFS) that stream the centroids of active fire detection pixels for MODIS and VIIRS as geographic point features. The services allow end users to manipulate and analyze features in the services using a geospatial client. These services are configured to enable access to MODIS or VIIRS active fire data for the past 24 hours or the past 7 days. Please see the WFS information page for FIRMS US/Canada and FIRMS Global for service connection information and tutorials on how to access the services. FIRMS US/Canada Prototype Released Diane Davies posted on Jan 09, 2021 FIRMS US/Canada is a new version of Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) focused on the US and Canada, developed in partnership between NASA and the US Forest Service.

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m thermal anomalies / active fire product provides data from the VIIRS sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. The 375 m data complements Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375 m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity.

Fire products from VIIRS: A complementary VIIRS M-Band 750 m active fire data product is available in HDF format from NASA's Earthdata Search and from the University of Maryland VIIRS Active Fire Web page . FIRMS has opted to distribute the 375 m product rather than the 750 m product as the increased spatial resolution and increased number of fires detected is of interest to the to the broader fire management community.

It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence values are set to low, nominal and high. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those free of potential sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels. Please note: Low confidence nighttime pixels occur only over the geographic area extending from 11deg E to 110 deg W and 7 deg N to 55 deg S. This area describes the region of influence of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly which can cause spurious brightness temperatures in the mid-infrared channel I4 leading to potential false positive alarms. These have been removed from the NRT data distributed by FIRMS.

FRP Fire Radiative Power FRP depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (megawatts). FRP depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (megawatts). Given the unique spatial and spectral resolution of the data, the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm was customized and tuned in order to optimize its response over small fires while balancing the occurrence of false alarms. Frequent saturation of the mid-infrared I4 channel (3.55-3.93 µm) driving the detection of active fires requires additional tests and procedures to avoid pixel classification errors. As a result, sub-pixel fire characterization (e.g., fire radiative power [FRP] retrieval) is only viable across small and/or low-intensity fires. Systematic FRP retrievals are based on a hybrid approach combining 375 and 750 m data. In fact, starting in 2015 the algorithm incorporated additional VIIRS channel M13 (3.973-4.128 µm) 750 m data in both aggregated and unaggregated format. DayNight Day or Night D= Daytime fire, N= Nighttime fire Image The VIIRS pixel footprint size projected onto the Earth increases away from nadir. The VIIRS I-Band 375 m Active Fire Product Algorithm The VIIRS 375 m active fire product is described in Schroeder et al (2014) . The product builds on the MODIS fire product heritage [ Kaufman et al., 1998; Giglio et al., 2003 et al. ], using a multi-spectral contextual algorithm to identify sub-pixel fire activity and other thermal anomalies in the Level 1 (swath) input data. The algorithm uses all five 375 m VIIRS channels to detect fires and separate land, water, and cloud pixels in the image. Additional 750 m channels complement the available VIIRS multispectral data. Those channels are used as input to the baseline active fire detection product, which provides continuity to the EOS/MODIS 1km Fire and Thermal Anomalies product. Some Key information about VIIRS The VIIRS sensor aboard the Suomi NPP satellite, crosses the equator at approximately 13:30 PM (ascending node) and 1:30 AM (descending node). The VIIRS sensor aboard the NOAA-20 satellite, crosses the equator approximately 50 minutes prior to Suomi NPP, at approximately 12:40 PM (ascending node) and 12:40 AM (descending node). The 3,040 km VIIRS swath enables ~15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator, thereby providing full global coverage every 12 hours and mid-latitudes will experience 3-4 looks a day. VIIRS has 5 high resolution Imagery channels (I-bands), 16 moderate resolution channels (M-bands) and a Day/Night Band (DNB). The VIIRS detectors have a constant angular resolution that results in an increasing pixel footprint size as the scan is further from nadir (see figure 1 below). This means the actual area of each scan has the shape of a bow-tie, as consecutive scans overlap away from nadir. The bow-tie effect is reduced during processing through a combination of aggregation and deletion of overlapping pixels.

FRP Fire Radiative Power FRP depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in megawatts (MW). Given the unique spatial and spectral resolution of the data, the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm was customized and tuned to optimize its response over small fires while balancing the occurrence of false alarms. Frequent saturation of the mid-infrared I4 channel (3.55-3.93 µm) driving the detection of active fires requires additional tests and procedures to avoid pixel classification errors. As a result, sub-pixel fire characterization (e.g., fire radiative power [FRP] retrieval) is only viable across small and/or low-intensity fires. Systematic FRP retrievals are based on a hybrid approach combining 375 and 750 m data. In fact, starting in 2015 the algorithm incorporated additional VIIRS channel M13 (3.973-4.128 µm) 750 m data in both aggregated and unaggregated format.

LANCE processes data as soon as they are downlinked from satellites or transmitted from ground stations, generally within 30 minutes to two hours after satellite observation. Routines used to derive Level 2 products, such as fire, snow, and sea ice products, do not make use of ancillary data and therefore their codes are identical to the ones used in standard operations. Generally, the difference between NRT and standard products is that the NRT data are subject to geolocation errors or reprocessing. Usually the geolocational errors are minimal (less than 100 meters); however, there are situations, particularly before and after spacecraft maneuvers and during space weather events, when the difference can increase up to several kilometers.

Smith Nov 11, 2022 Image A United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta II rocket carrying the joint NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite lifts off from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on October 28, 2011. Credit: NASA/ULA. The joint NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) satellite launched into space on October 28, 2011. Designed as a bridge mission to provide continuity between NASA’s Earth Observation System ( EOS ) satellites and the next-generation spacecraft of the Joint Polar Satellite System ( JPSS ), Suomi NPP’s successful entry into low Earth orbit paved the way for the launch of NOAA-20 (formerly JPSS-1) on November 18, 2017, and JPSS-2 , which rocketed into space November 10, 2022, and will be known as NOAA-21. Like their EOS predecessors, JPSS satellites collect critical meteorological data for short-term, seasonal, and long-term forecasting; global measurements of atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial conditions; and extend the multidecade data records that enable the study of long-term climate trends. As the first JPSS satellite, Suomi NPP provided nearly an order of magnitude more data than the spacecraft of the EOS system. It also gave NASA and its partner agencies access to and experience with the JPSS' latest and most advanced sensors, thereby facilitating the data continuity efforts associated with the transition from NASA's EOS. In addition, working with Suomi NPP also gave scientists and engineers an opportunity to test the operations systems on the ground and validate sensors and algorithms while the technologies of the current system were still in place. As part of the efforts to validate those new sensors and the algorithms that interpret the data they provide, NASA's Earth Science Data and Information System ( ESDIS ) Project supports five Science Investigator-led Processing Systems ( SIPS ), which are responsible for producing, assessing, processing, and reprocessing products from Suomi NPP's instruments: the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder ( ATMS ), the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System ( CERES ), the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder ( CrIS ), the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite ( OMPS ), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ). Over the years, the SIPS' work has helped NASA and NOAA meet the goals of the Suomi NPP mission and benefitted long-term studies of global change. \"The Suomi NPP SIPS are responsible for processing and reprocessing data products,\" said Evelyn Ho, SIPS Manager for ESDIS. \"They work very closely with the Principal Investigators (PIs) and science team leads (TLs), who develop the algorithms, in testing the updated algorithm in a production-like environment and generating test datasets for evaluation to ensure it produces consistent and good quality data.\" Like all NASA SIPS, the Suomi NPP SIPS are geographically distributed across the United States and are generally (but not always) collocated with the Science Computing Facilities ( SCFs ) that process data from a specific instrument or mission. When a new or reprocessed data product is ready for release, the SIPS sends it to the appropriate NASA Distributed Active Archive Center ( DAAC ) for archiving and distribution. Thanks to the SIPS, data users have more than 10,000 unique data products that are constantly reprocessed and improved to provide the best research-caliber data possible. NASA's five Suomi NPP SIPS are: The Atmosphere SIPS is responsible for the production, processing, reprocessing, and general assessment of Suomi NPP VIIRS Atmosphere Products. It delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to NASA's Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System DAAC ( LAADS DAAC ) via the Land SIPS, the Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC ), the Atmospheric Science Data Center ( ASDC ), and NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE) . The Land SIPS is responsible for the production, processing, reprocessing, and general assessment of the Suomi NPP Science Team standard and experimental VIIRS Land Products. It delivers its data products along with the scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to NASA's LAADS DAAC, National Snow and Ice Data Center DAAC ( NSIDC DAAC ), and Land Processes DAAC ( LP DAAC ). The Ocean SIPS is responsible for producing, processing, reprocessing, and general assessments of Suomi NPP VIIRS Ocean Products. It delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to NASA's Ocean Biology DAAC ( OB.DAAC ). The Ozone SIPS is responsible for processing and reprocessing Suomi NPP OMPS Nadir and Limb products. It delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to the OMPS website and GES DISC. The Sounder SIPS is responsible for the production, processing, and reprocessing of data products from Suomi NPP's ATMS and CrIS, which are collectively referred to as the Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS). It too delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to GES DISC. Image An artist's rendering of the Suomi NPP satellite in low Earth orbit. Credit: JPSS. In addition to these five SIPS, there is the CERES SCF, which is co-located with ASDC and managed and funded by the CERES Principal Investigator. The CERES SCF is responsible for the production, processing, reprocessing, and general assessment of the Suomi NPP Science Team standard and experimental CERES Products. It delivers its data products along with scientific algorithm software, associated metadata, and documentation to ASDC. The Suomi NPP SIPS process Level 0 data to Level 2 products and global gridded Level 3 products using the scientific algorithm software from their respective Suomi NPP Discipline Group. Four of the five SIPS acquire near real-time algorithms for selected products and then process and deliver them, within three hours, for distribution through LANCE. The Ocean SIPS, however, acquires near real-time algorithms for selected products and then processes and delivers them, within three hours, for distribution through NASA's Physical Oceanography DAAC ( PO.DAAC ). Given that Suomi NPP has been in orbit for the past 11 years, one might assume the SIPS' work is somewhat routine. Yet, it remains challenging for several reasons, including the variation with which satellite data are received. \"The SIPS work with different external providers for Level 0 data products, ancillary data products, and any additional supporting information that are needed to generate a standard data product,\" said Ho. \"The difficulty is that not all this information is available at the same time.\" Indeed, raw satellite data often arrive at different times and in separate data streams and formats, which requires them to be aligned to meet algorithm requirements. This means the SIPS have to account for the data on each interface and track down missing observations to ensure that processing keeps up with the continuous, operational instrument data flows. In addition, satellites (and the instrument missions they support) frequently enter and exit the EOS constellation, so the SIPS must regularly and quickly incorporate changes to data calibration parameters and algorithms, and reprocess existing data to ensure the accuracy of long-term data records over the life of a mission as well as from one satellite mission to another. \"[The SIPS] provide various tools and applications to support the science teams in monitoring the products and conducting data analysis,\" Ho said. \"They also reprocess the data if the science teams request it, as a result of algorithm or calibration updates. Reprocessing is done to make sure that the records or that data collection is up to date for an entire mission or long-term data record, which is critically important for research.\" This issue is particularly timely now, as NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites have begun their Constellation Exit Maneuvers and the instruments aboard Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, and JPSS-2 become more essential . \"Suomi NPP was meant to bridge the EOS and JPSS missions, so by working with Suomi NPP instruments and data over the years, the PIs and science teams gained early experience with the data from the instruments and their algorithms,\" Ho said. Image This map shows the locations of NASA's five Suomi NPP SIPS and how most, but not all, are collocated with the Scientific Computing Facilities that process data from a specific instrument. Credit: NASA EOSDIS. Elaine Prins, project manager for the Atmosphere SIPS, concurs and says, \"The SIPS have played a pivotal role in meeting the goal of the [Suomi NPP] mission to extend global measurements for long-term monitoring of climate trends that began with NASA's EOS missions and continues into the future with the operational JPSS series.\" According to Prins, the success of the Atmosphere SIPS is rooted in the groundwork, tools, and capabilities developed under the precursor to the SIPS—the NPP Product and Evaluation and Test Elements program—and the relationships honed with a variety of science teams that began in 2007. \"This early work played a significant role in facilitating a smooth transition to the Atmosphere SIPS with a focus on implementing and maintaining an investigator-led processing system,\" she said. \"The Atmosphere SIPS team works collaboratively with the VIIRS Atmosphere science teams on initial planning, scientific algorithm software integration, testing, operational implementation, data ingest monitoring, product generation and delivery, and ongoing evaluation.\" The Atmosphere SIPS ingests Suomi NPP and JPSS VIIRS, CrIS, and other ancillary data 24 hours per day, seven days a week, with global atmosphere products generated in standard processing mode and, for select products, near real-time mode. When science teams deliver updated code with product improvements, the Atmosphere SIPS can reprocess Suomi NPP and JPSS mission records within days to weeks. The SIPS also preserve information about the origins and development of science production software and product generation, which is essential for future researchers and user communities. Hence Prins' assessment that, \"The support and capabilities provided by the SIPS for Suomi NPP and the follow-on JPSS series satellites are crucial for producing high quality consistent multi-decade Earth system data records for global change evaluation studies.\" In this way, the work of the SIPS is also important to NASA's ESDIS Project as a whole, as its mission is to process, archive, and distribute high-quality data to the scientists and others conducting the research required to meet the on-going and complex challenges of climate and environmental change.

Joseph Smith Nov 9, 2022 Image NASA EOSDIS System Manager and LANCE Manager, Karen Michael. Credit: NASA ESDIS Project. NASA’s Earth Science Data and Information System ( ESDIS ) Project manages the science systems of NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System ( EOSDIS ), which provides NASA Earth science data to a wide community of users around the globe. In that capacity, the project is responsible for processing, archiving, and distributing Earth science data products, providing tools to facilitate these efforts, improving services for users, ensuring scientists and the public have access to NASA data, and promoting the interdisciplinary use of EOSDIS data to a range of existing and potential user communities. Karen Michael has been involved in this mission since 1995, and, as she put it, her career just “evolved over time.” Today, Michael is a System Manager of EOSDIS, a position in which she works to define the responsibilities of flight projects when sending their data to NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers ( DAACs ), and manager of NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ), a position in which she works to enhance LANCE's reliability, reduce data latency, and make more users aware of the availability of near real-time (NRT) data. In the following interview, Michael discusses her career path, her work with EOSDIS and LANCE, the common aim of her main roles, and how, after 27 years, she still finds ESDIS to be a project in which she can work and grow. I'd like to begin by asking about your career path. How did you come to work for ESDIS? My route to working at NASA was a little unusual. In my first job after graduation, I worked as a chemist in a materials science laboratory. While working there full time, I went back to school part time and got a degree in electrical engineering, and I became interested in robotics. While in the lab, I worked on several NASA contracts, one of which involved making superconductors. I wanted to work for NASA in robotics though, and when the opportunity arose I applied for an engineering position with the agency. I was hired as a civil servant and as there were no positions available in robotics, my first job was designing hardware for a lossless data compression algorithm (i.e., a method of data compression without the loss of information). While working in the hardware lab at NASA, I went back to school at night and got a degree in engineering management. Sometime later, a coworker who had gone to work for ESDIS announced he was leaving his job and he thought I might be interested in it, so I applied, got it, and began working in integrating and testing for ESDIS for the then upcoming TRMM mission. I really enjoyed working in the ESDIS Project and felt it was a good opportunity for me to grow. I started working with interfaces, documents, and projects and it just evolved over time. I began managing some of the tests for upcoming launches, such as for NASA’s Aqua satellite and the NASA-USGS Landsat 7 satellite. Later, when the system management position became available, I applied for that and got it. I’ve been in ESDIS for about 27 years now and I still find it an excellent project to grow in. The work keeps coming with each new mission and there’s always something new. You fulfill two major roles: EOSDIS System Manager and LANCE Manager. What does each position entail and what are your main areas of focus? As system manager, I work with the flight projects, whose data we serve through the DAACs. Basically, I’m the first person in ESDIS to interface with the flight projects and help define what their roles and responsibilities are for providing data to the DAACs. I also manage NASA’s LANCE, which is our near real-time data system. In most cases, the flight projects are generating standard (or high-level, science-quality) products, which go to the DAACs. The LANCE is a distributed system that produces near real-time products, which are available prior to the standard products and are not archived. In fact, we want users to take the standard products when they’re available. So, the application of LANCE data is much different. In regard to your role as EOSDIS System Manager, what is the most difficult aspect of coordinating configuration management on a project like ESDIS? Configuration management (CM) is very important. CM is how we manage changes to requirements, design, and interfaces in order to maintain integrity. Creating and reviewing documents, however, is not something that scientists and engineers generally like to do, so getting them to do it in a timely manner is probably the biggest challenge. In addition, ESDIS is a big project with a long history, so another challenge is just the sheer number of documents we have and the number of accounts we have to manage. Just to give you some idea, I looked into NASA's Configuration Management EOSDIS Tool (COMET) yesterday, which is our content management system, and found that we have close to 200 documents under configuration management. We also have more than 500 users of the system, and looking back to historical documents, we have close to 1,500 that were under CM. What are the critical steps when coordinating a NASA mission and parts of the EOSDIS data systems, for example the DAACs? Data from these missions are archived by the DAACs and the selection of which discipline-specific DAAC will archive the data is usually based on the mission’s scientific goals. So, I work with the flight projects to help them understand what their roles and responsibilities are for providing data to the DAACs, and then we get into the interface control document, which defines the protocol and the details of the data exchange. Standardizing the interfaces is really key to keeping the cost and complexity down, so what we try to do is maintain very similar interfaces. We have the DAACs standardized in the way that they ingest and archive and distribute, and in the same manner, the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), which is our imagery browsing system has a standard type of interface. The way that metadata, which are what make data searchable and allow for the efficient management of large data collections, is provided is also very standardized. Switching gears now to your work as LANCE Manager, what would you say is LANCE's most important objective? Is it making more NRT data available? Reducing latency? System reliability? Or perhaps making more users aware that NRT data are available to them? I think all those things are important, but if I had to pick one, it would be reducing latency, because that’s the main reason LANCE exists and has become so popular. The data from LANCE has really enabled NASA Worldview and NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ), which provides near real-time active fire data to the wildland fire community, to provide imagery in a timely manner to decision-makers all over the world. Worldview and FIRMS are among the top NASA sites visited every day, and for good reason. I think users really like the responsiveness of the low latency data. When you get on Worldview that’s the first thing you see—the imagery that’s just been collected—and the beauty of it is that you don’t need to be a scientist to use Worldview and FIRMS. Can you explain what makes LANCE data different from the standard products archived at the DAACs? Standard products are stored at the DAACs and they’re for scientific research and the long-term climate record. LANCE NRT products are used for short-term weather prediction or by people like wildland firefighters and first responders to hazards and disasters who don’t have time to wait for standard products to be processed. It’s the timeliness of the data that they need. But producing products quicker means they’re not as good as the standard products, and so things like the geolocation may be slightly off, because we’re using things like predicted ephemeris (i.e., data that provide the assigned places of a celestial body or human-made satellite at regular intervals) and not waiting for ancillary data that’s also used in standard processing. In a lot of cases, standard processing involves waiting for other sources of data to come in and be available before the processing can start, whereas with LANCE we bypass that step. [Note: Read an in-depth explanation of NRT versus standard products .] What do you see for the future of NRT data and LANCE? For a while, near real-time or low latency data wasn’t given much attention at NASA, but it’s starting to be something that future missions are looking at. Maybe it’s not their first objective, but as a second objective. Managing LANCE is something that’s near and dear to my heart. I’ve been with it since its inception and I’ve seen the impact that it’s had. I really hope to see LANCE continue to grow in the future. I think it’s going to be a bit more challenging in that some of the upcoming missions really don’t have NRT requirements. Getting those requests in later is always harder, that’s the lesson we’ve learned from the past, but we’re still seeing it happen because science objectives are what drive missions and standard products are usually the first priority. I have been involved in latency studies for some upcoming missions and they are considering some NRT applications so I’m hoping to see LANCE continue to evolve. Does NASA keep statistics about how many people accessing NRT data each day? We do collect those metrics. We collect a lot of metrics about the data we distribute and who we distribute it to. For LANCE there are close to 300 image and data products being distributed at a volume of 40-75 Terabytes per week to users in more than 200 countries. We also track our latency to make sure we’re staying below the three hours or less benchmark for LANCE. How do user requests come to you? Do they come to you through the LANCE User Working Group or are there other mechanisms for that? We have two primary mechanisms for that. One is a survey that we conduct about every two years that goes out to LANCE users and the community. It asks these kinds of questions: What data do they use? How do they use it? and What would they like to see provided in the future? We also receive requests through the LANCE User Working Group ( UWG ), and we take requests from any user who has an application that’s not being filled or who has an idea. They fill out a LANCE enhancement request and we review it and figure out if and how it can be implemented and what it would cost to do it. Then we go back to the ESDIS Project and see if we have the funding. If we don’t, we go to [NASA] Headquarters and request funding. If headquarters approves it, then we go forward. That’s how we’ve been operating in LANCE. It’s a little different from the rest of EOSDIS, because LANCE itself doesn’t really have a budget that allows me to say, this is what we’re going to do this year or next year. It’s based on requests from users and the community. How frequently do you receive such requests and are they for products that are attainable? Our UWG meets twice a year, so it could be two times per year. Sometimes we don’t get any requests in the spring and we get three requests in the fall, so maybe on the order of one or two a year. Typically, it’s been requests for something we have a standard product for, but someone wants it in NRT. Basically, it’s the same standard algorithm, but with modifications required to make it run in NRT. Every once in a while, it might be another source of data that we haven’t collected before. So now, for example, in FIRMS we’re getting direct readout data. It may be the same data that we’re bringing down normally, but in this case we’re getting it even faster, so the request is made for more timely data, such as less than an hour instead of three hours. So, given the purview of your two roles, is it fair to say they’re both focused on ensuring users have access to the data they need? Yes, I would say that for sure. We’re serving users. That’s what we’re here to do and I think that’s common to both the standard products and the NRT products available through LANCE. We’re always listening to what users need and trying to improve on what we provide in regard to the formats users want the data to be in, providing the requested imagery, making it easier to access and use NASA Earth science data, and so on.

LANCE (Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS) is a group of near real-time data systems serving the Land and Atmosphere science community. What is near real-time (NRT) data? Near real-time data are defined as data that are available to users three hours or less after a satellite observation. What near real-time systems are a part of LANCE? LANCE consists of \"elements\" that process the NRT data made available through LANCE. These are listed in the table below. LANCE Element Processing Center Instrument LANCE MODIS MODAPS (Goddard) MODIS LANCE AMSR AMSR SIPS (GHRC) AMSR2 LANCE AIRS GES DISC (Goddard) AIRS LANCE MLS MLS SIPS (Jet Propulsion Laboratory [JPL]) MLS LANCE OMI Ozone SIPS (Goddard) OMI LANCE MISR MISR SIPS (JPL) MISR LANCE VIIRS - Atmosphere Suomi NPP Atmosphere SIPS (SSEC, University of Wisconsin-Madison) VIIRS LANCE VIIRS - Land Suomi NPP Land SIPS (Goddard) VIIRS LANCE OMPS Ozone SIPS (Goddard) OMPS LANCE MOPITT MOPITT SIPS (NCAR) MOPITT LANCE LIS (ISS) AMSR SIPS (GHRC) ISS What are standard products? Standard products are products that are used for standard science processing and are generally available between 8-40 hours after observation. What is the difference between near real-time and standard products? Near real-time and standard products differ in the amount of processing the raw data receives. Near real-time data is processed with different, less accurate ancillary data to make it available to users within 3 hours of observation. The main difference is in geolocation due to the use of predictive orbit information vs waiting for definitive orbit information. Where can I obtain standard products? Each LANCE element provides standard products as well as near real-time products. Go to the Standard Products page for the data centers where the standard products are archived. What LANCE data products are available?

For both MODIS and VIIRS, the Corrected Reflectance algorithm utilizes Level 1B data (the calibrated, geolocated radiances). It is not a standard, science quality product and is available only as near real-time imagery. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview and GIBS. For MODIS, the sensor resolution is 500 m and 250 m (Bands 1 and 2 have a sensor resolution of 250 m, Bands 3 – 7 have a sensor resolution of 500m, and Bands 8 - 36 are 1 km. Band 1 is used to sharpen Band 3, 4, 6, and 7), imagery resolution is 250 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.The purpose of this algorithm is to provide natural-looking images by removing gross atmospheric effects, such as Rayleigh scattering, from MODIS visible bands 1-7. The algorithm was developed by the original MODIS Rapid Response team to address the needs of the fire monitoring community who want to see smoke. Corrected Reflectance shows smoke more clearly than the standard Surface Reflectance product. In contrast, the MODIS Land Surface Reflectance product (MOD09) is a more complete atmospheric correction algorithm that includes aerosol correction, and is designed to derive land surface properties. In clear atmospheric conditions, the Corrected Reflectance product is very similar to the MOD09 product, but they depart from each other in presence of aerosols. If you wish to perform a complete atmospheric correction, please do not use the Corrected Reflectance algorithm. An additional difference is that the Land Surface Reflectance product is only tuned for calculating the reflectance over land surfaces. The VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery provides continuity from the MODIS Corrected Reflectance imagery and was developed to provide natural-looking images by removing gross atmospheric effects such as Rayleigh scattering from the visible bands. By contrast, the Surface Reflectance product is available in near real-time and as a standard product. Surface Reflectance provides a more complete atmospheric correction algorithm that includes aerosol correction and is designed to derive land surface properties. In clear atmospheric conditions the corrected reflectance product is similar to the Surface Reflectance product but they depart from each other in the presence of aerosols. MODIS Near Real-Time Data What is MODIS? MODIS stands for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The MODIS instrument is aboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. The orbit of the Terra satellite goes from north to south across the equator in the morning and Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon resulting in global coverage every 1 to 2 days. The EOS satellites have a ±55 degree scanning pattern and orbit at 705 km with a 2,330 km swath width.The MODIS instrument provides 36 spectral bands from wavelengths of 0.4µm to 14.4µm. For more information, please visit the NASA MODIS website . When were the Terra and Aqua satellites launched? Terra (EOS AM) was launched 18 December 1999 and Aqua (EOS PM) was launched 4 May 2002. High quality hotspot/active fire observations are available from the Terra satellite starting November 2000 and from the Aqua satellite starting 4 July 2002 onwards. What time does the satellite pass over my area? Terra (EOS AM) passes over the equator at approximately 10:30 am and 10:30 pm each day, Aqua (EOS PM) satellite passes over the equator at approximately 1:30 pm and 1:30 am. The sun-synchronous orbit allows the satellites to pass over the same area at the same time in every 24 hour period (at every 99 minute orbit the satellites cross the equator at the above mentioned times; every other spot on Earth has similarly constant overpass times). The time of satellite pass will vary according to your location. To estimate when the satellite will pass over your area, you can use the satellite overpass predictor provided by NASA. Daily Terra and Aqua global and regional orbit tracks are provided by the Space Science and Engineering Center ( SSEC ) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . The maps show a series of white lines with tic marks showing what time the satellite will pass over a certain location on the Earth. The white lines represent the center of the swath and the tic marks and time show at what time in UTC the satellite has passed over that location. Image A cut-away from an orbit track map showing the Terra satellite overpass time near the Great Lakes (daytime granule starting at 17:10 UTC, nighttime granule starting at 03:35 UTC). The maps have a series of white lines with tick marks on them that show what time (using Coordinated Universal Time , or UTC) the satellite will be passing over a particular location on Earth on a given day. The white lines represent the center of the swath. The time stamps mark the start of the northern (Terra) or southern (Aqua) edge of each 5-minute data collection period. An image acquired at that location will span roughly 1150 kilometers on either side of the tick mark. Every day there are two passes over most areas: one daylight pass, and one nighttime pass. How often are data acquired? The MODIS instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua EOS satellites acquire data continuously providing global coverage every 1-2 days. Therefore there are at least 4 daily MODIS observations for almost every area on the equator – with the number of overpasses increasing (due to overlapping orbits) the closer an area is to the poles. See What time does the satellite pass over my area? What are MODIS Data \"Collections\"? A MODIS data Collection is a MODIS data version. When new and improved science algorithms are developed, the entire MODIS dataset (from launch) is reprocessed and then tagged and distributed as a new \"Collection\". During the process of a Collection, an attempt is made to use the same version of the Science Algorithms or Program Executables (PGEs). However, sometimes a bug is found in one or more of the PGEs in the middle of Collection processing; and if the bug is not serious, processing will complete with the new corrected PGE. These anomalies and problems in processing are noted on the Known Problems page. One can always identify the Collection number for a particular HDF file as it's always included (as a 3 digit number) as part of the HDF filename. There have been six MODIS data Collections (or Versions) processed since MODIS/Terra was launched in early 2000. The Collection versions created thus far are 001, 003, 004, 005, 051, 006 and 06.1. MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1) was added in October 2017 to correct a number of issues in the Collection 6 (C6) Level-1B (L1B) data. The decision to create a new improved C6.1 was driven by the MODIS Atmosphere team to address a number of issues in the current C6 L1B data. These L1B issues had a negative impact in varying degrees in downstream MODIS Atmosphere Level-2 (L2) and Level-3 (L3) products. More information can be found at the MODIS Atmosphere website . Starting in November 2017, C6 Land processing stream will use the C6.1 L1B as input, with no change to the land-science processing algorithms. We do not expect to see any significant impact to most land products from using upstream C6.1 as inputs except for some minor differences in Terra MODIS snow and sea-ice products because of differences in the Terra cloud mask. Therefore, C6 processing of NRT Terra- and Aqua-MODIS Land products will continue until sometime around the middle of 2018, when C6.1 processing of Land products will start. VIIRS Near Real Time Data What is VIIRS? Image The VIIRS pixel footprint size projected onto the Earth increases away from nadir. VIIRS stands for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The VIIRS sensor was launched aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) satellite on October 28th, 2011 and again on the NOAA-20 / Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1) satellite. (Note: JPSS-1 was renamed NOAA-20 after launch). Suomi NPP crosses the equator at approximately 13:30 PM (ascending node) and 1.30 AM (descending node). NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) leads Suomi NPP by a half orbit so it crosses the equator approximately 50 minutes earlier. The 3,040 km VIIRS swath enables ~15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator, thereby providing full global coverage every 12 hours and mid-latitudes will experience 3-4 looks a day. VIIRS has 5 high resolution imagery channels (I-bands), 16 moderate resolution channels (M-bands) and a Day/Night Band (DNB). The VIIRS detectors have a constant angular resolution that results in an increasing pixel footprint size as the scan is further from nadir (see figure 1 below). This means the actual area of each scan has the shape of a bow-tie, as consecutive scans overlap away from nadir. The bow-tie effect is reduced during processing through a combination of aggregation and deletion of overlapping pixels. What VIIRS products are available in LANCE? The VIIRS I-band (375 m) Active Fire product and Corrected Reflectance imagery are the newest near real-time products available through LANCE. More will follow. The active fire product will be available in FIRMS and images created from these data products, and Corrected Reflectance images are now available through GIBS for viewing using EOSDIS Worldview and similar clients. The new VIIRS images available through GIBS are Corrected Reflectance (True Color; Bands M3, I3, and M11; and Bands M11, I2, and I1) and Fires and Thermal Anomalies (Day/Night).

Moses, System Engineer, NASA Earth Observing System (SSAI, Inc.) Oct 31, 2022 Image Miles above Earth's surface, a thin layer of ozone gas acts as a shield that protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Credit: NASA. Ozone (O 3 ), a gas made up of three oxygen atoms, is something of a double-edged compound. In the upper stratosphere, where it occurs naturally, ozone protects life on Earth from the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. This is the so-called “good” ozone. Yet, in the troposphere, the lowest level atmosphere near Earth's surface, ozone can be created by reactions between airborne pollutants, and at ground level, high ozone concentrations can be toxic to humans. This is the “bad” ozone. The natural concentration of ozone in the troposphere is about 10 parts per billion (10 molecules for every billion air molecules), much lower than the 2-8 parts per million in the ozone layer where most (85-90%) of the planet's ozone is located. However, the levels of tropospheric ozone can rise when nitrogen oxide gases from vehicle and industrial emissions react with volatile organic compounds (e.g., carbon-containing chemicals such as paint thinners) that evaporate easily into the air. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to ozone levels of greater than 70 parts per billion for 8 hours or longer is unhealthy . Such concentrations occur in or near cities during periods where the atmosphere is warm and stable, and the harmful effects of prolonged exposure can result in throat and lung irritation, aggravation of asthma, or emphysema. Fortunately, the presence of ozone and other trace (small percentage) gasses in the atmosphere, including pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), can be detected by their unique spectral signatures. This is precisely what the Ozone Monitoring Instrument ( OMI ) aboard NASA's Aura satellite was created to do. NASA launched the Aura satellite, the third of its flagship Earth Observing System satellite missions behind Terra and Aqua, in 2004. Flying about 15 minutes behind Aqua as part of the Afternoon Constellation (or A-train ) of Earth-observing satellites, Aura's four instruments—the Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS ), the High-Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder ( HIRDLS ), the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer ( TES ), and OMI—were designed to collect data about the chemistry and dynamics of Earth's atmosphere, enabling scientists to investigate the presence and trends in atmospheric trace gas concentrations, the trends and processes that create various atmospheric conditions, and the impact of climate change on air quality. One of the most important aims of the Aura mission was to assess and monitor the stratospheric ozone layer. Concern about ozone depletion in the 1970s led to a congressional mandate that charged NASA and NOAA with developing ways to monitor and track the amounts of ozone and ozone-depleting gases in the atmosphere. Following the discovery of the ozone hole over the South Pole by NASA and British researchers in the early 1980s and the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , which sought to end the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) beginning in 1987, NASA has routinely monitored the state of stratospheric ozone levels around the globe to assess the ozone hole's recovery. Monitoring serves to gauge the effect of regulations designed to curb the use of ozone-depleting chemicals. OMI Origins Image The OMI instrument’s UV and visible infrared channels provide high resolution measurements of backscatter radiation from which scientists can retrieve concentrations of ozone and other trace gases. Credit: NASA Scientific Visualization Studio. To help it perform these critical roles, NASA partnered with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute ( KNMI ) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute ( FMI ) to develop and operate the OMI instrument. Built by Dutch Space (now Airbus Defense and Space Netherlands ) and aerospace company TNO , OMI is a nadir-viewing wide-field-imaging spectrometer designed to provide high-resolution observations of O 3 , NO 2 (total as well as tropospheric columns), and SO 2 , as well as other trace gases and aerosols like dust and smoke by measuring mid-range ultraviolet (UV) and visible infrared radiation from multiple fields of view simultaneously. As such, it is an improvement over legacy sensors such as the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS ) aboard NASA’s Earth Probe Satellite and the European Space Agency's ( ESA ) Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment ( GOME ) instrument aboard the ESA ERS-2 satellite “OMI was the first to obtain daily global coverage with very high spatial resolution, measuring ultraviolet and visible spectra at the same time,” said OMI Principal Investigator Dr. Pieternel Levelt. “So, there was an expectation that we could improve on the space-based ozone and air quality measurements with OMI. Its potential to measure air pollution and emission sources in the troposphere turned out to be unprecedented” Those expectations were spot on. “One of the very interesting things that came out of our research work with OMI was the ability to determine tropospheric ozone with techniques like cloud slicing,” said U.S. OMI science team leader Dr. Joanna Joiner. “By measuring the total column ozone above thick clouds we can determine the stratospheric ozone amount accurately in the tropics. Defining stratosphere ozone, which of course lies between the instrument and troposphere, is important for being able to determine trends in tropospheric ozone.” OMI is not the only instrument aboard Aura that measures ozone and trace gases. MLS provides high vertical resolution profiles of the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) that are nearly simultaneous with those from OMI. By combining these observations with meteorological data, scientists have developed algorithms that separate out the ozone observed in the stratosphere from ozone in the atmospheric column to derive measurements of tropospheric ozone. OMI and MLS observations have also been combined with atmospheric profiles of O 3 from the TES instrument, giving atmospheric scientists a better understanding of the stratospheric and tropospheric contributions to ozone as well as the physical and chemical processes that effect their distributions in these layers of the atmosphere. Image Left image: OMI and MLS can estimate the tropospheric ozone residual by subtracting the MLS stratospheric ozone from the OMI column ozone. High residual regions correspond to pollution sources and transport. Right image: The monthly mean maps show pollution streaming from biomass burning in the equatorial zone in the Southern Hemisphere (upper image); streaming from the United States, Europe, and China in the Northern Hemisphere summer (lower image); and the transport of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere.

Beyond ozone, OMI has improved the detection of atmospheric SO 2 from erupting and outgassing volcanoes, oil and gas production sites, power plants, and other industrial operations. “Detecting individual sources of SO 2 —sources that were previously undetected and not in the emissions databases used by modelers—quantifying them, and tracing them over time has been an exciting challenge,” said Joiner. “Trends in SO 2 and NO 2 have been surprising, both upwards and downwards and in different parts of the world. So, being able to measure and track them accurately has been important.” OMI has also enhanced the detection of aerosols and provided insight into their effects on climatological phenomena. “When you have more smoke over clouds the sunlight gets absorbed by the smoke and the dust, and the clouds reflect less light,” said Joiner. “For example, we've seen recent fires, very intense fires, that create a large amount of absorbing material that gets very high in the atmosphere, and it can remain for long periods of time and impact the radiation balance. It's important to have a long-term record so that when such events happen in the future we can get an idea of how frequent they are.” Image This map shows the location of sulfur dioxide emissions as detected by emissions databases and satellite observations . Red rectangles highlight daily volcanic regions, green areas show regions with short-term daily pollution, and blue areas identify locations with long-term pollution. Previously undetected individual sources were identified using OMI data. Credit: NASA Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Laboratory. These improvements are a direct result of OMI's high-resolution measurements. \"With small pixels one can measure in-between clouds more often, which is important for penetrating to the lower kilometers in the troposphere for measuring air pollution,\" said Levelt. \"With an instrument like OMI that measures across the ultraviolet and visible spectrum, one cannot measure through the clouds, just as we cannot see through a cloud with our own eyes. Therefore, it is important to have small pixels so that the instrument measures the pollution residing in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Moreover, the smaller the pixels, the better one can measure and localize small emission sources.\" OMI also advanced the use of satellites for air quality observations by offering measurements for never-before-seen areas. \"People thought you couldn't see pollution in sparsely populated areas at high latitudes like Finland. It was thought to be clean and nothing there,\" said FMI's Dr. Johanna Tamminen, an OMI Co-Principal Investigator. \"But when we started to average data, zoom, and adjust display scales, OMI started to show us interesting things. It was a real eye-opener that we could also use satellites to look at the air quality in Finland.\" Of course, OMI's most significant contribution to the atmospheric research community , as noted in this 2018 paper by Levelt, et al., is its long-term, 18-year data record. \"Being able to observe atmospheric conditions at the city scale is allowing us to understand their impacts on human health and even health inequities depending on where people live. To do this you need a long-term data record,\" Joiner said. \"Air quality can change significantly based on the local weather. OMI's coverage allows you to compare a day from a week in February with the same week averaged over several previous years to draw reasonable conclusions by minimizing the impact local weather has on air pollution. You need an assessment of what normal NO 2 emissions look like to be able to see the impact.\" Identifying those long-term trends is essential for determining whether regulations, like those enacted to curb the use of CFCs or reduce emissions of NO 2 , are having an effect. OMI’s 18-year data record shows that they are. Image OMI's stability and low degradation makes it possible to see complex decadal trends in nitrogen dioxide, a common pollutant from cars and power plants, and sulfur dioxide from coal-fired power plants over environments where air quality data were previously not available.

The data show us that the U.S. and Europe have some of the highest emissions in the world,” said former U.S. President Barack Obama in a 2016 video from DNews. “But it also shows us that, in the last 25 years, NO 2 levels have dropped by up to 50% in both regions, thanks in large part to new rules that protect our air. Imagery like this can help us see what actions are working, and where we need to focus additional international efforts.” Having a consistent long-term data record allows researchers to establish local and seasonal baseline trends, so they can assess both normal conditions and the effects of out-of-the-ordinary events, when conditions may be changing rapidly. For example, by comparing data from the previous five years to measurements taken during COVID lockdowns, scientists were able to assess the lockdown's impact on transportation using OMI NO 2 observations. Beyond clarifying long-term atmospheric trends, scientists have used OMI's lengthy data record to devise new applications for the instrument's data, such as retrieving new trace gas species, helping evaluate physical models of the Sun, and experimenting with new inverse modelling techniques to estimate pollution emissions, such as along the coast of China. Image Nitrogen dioxide emissions and the impact of COVID lockdowns .

While the mandate was in effect, non-essential businesses were closed and approximately 6.7 million residents were asked to stay home. Right image: Comparisons of OMI nitrogen dioxide observations during normal activity for that time of year revealed a clearing of the air during lockdown, with an estimated 22% reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels.

As a case in point, a recent paper published in Frontiers of Remote Sensing discussed the use of OMI data to help fill gaps in the record of ocean color measurements , or the spectral composition of the visible light field that emanates from the ocean, which provides clues to the substances (e.g., phytoplankton and suspended sediments) that are dissolved and suspended in the water column. “Even after 18 years in space we're still learning new things that we can do with OMI and similar instruments,” said Joiner. “When we learn how to do something new, we can always go back and reprocess existing data to create a long record of new and improved products.” OMI's long-term data record is a consequence of the instrument's remarkable durability and stability. During its nearly two decades in space, OMI has experienced only minor optical problems, unusually low optical degradation over its lifespan, and detector degradation well within the expected range. This is significant as observational errors typically increase with sensor degradation. “Over its 18-year life, the detector degradation has reached the point where retrievals for trace gases like formaldehyde, which typically has very low spectral signatures, are difficult,” said Levelt. “As far as the other OMI products, the detector degradation may impact NO 2 and SO 2 products, but not to the level that it significantly challenges the retrievals. It's just amazing.” Image This graphic shows (a) the average of OMI tropospheric nitrogen dioxide column concentrations over the ocean along the coast of China from 2007 to 2016, (b) nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions over the ocean along the coast of China derived by daily emission estimates constrained from satellite measurements applied to OMI observations, and (c) three selected regions where shipping emissions were examined near the Chinese coast. (The circled numbers indicate the name of the regions, while the non-circled numbers indicate the locations of the country's main harbors. For more information, see Ding, et al., 2018 .) Of course, no instrument or satellite orbits Earth forever. Therefore, it likely came as little surprise when, after 18 years, NASA's Aura Project began reporting decommissioning scenarios, plans, and schedules at Mission Operations Working Group meetings. Various de-orbiting scenarios are under consideration, but eventually Aura's instruments will need to be turned off as part of spacecraft passivation, which is projected to occur in 2025 (if maximally extended). In the interim, Aura will drift from its traditional orbit, but the change is expected to be small and the impact on data quality is forecast to be minimal. Next Generation Instruments After Aura has been decommissioned, three newer instruments already in orbit—the Joint Polar Satellite System’s (JPSS) Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite ( OMPS ), the ESA GOME-2 instrument, and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument ( TROPOMI )—will become the primary sources for daily global hyperspectral observations of ozone and trace gases, including SO 2 and NO 2 . The OMPS instruments aboard the joint NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) and NOAA-20 satellites are now the operational instruments for NOAA's ozone monitoring program. OMPS was designed to measure atmospheric total column ozone with configurable nadir temporal (along-track) and spatial (across-track) resolutions. OMPS on Suomi NPP collects data at a larger 50x50 km pixel size, while NOAA-20 OMPS observations are collected at a smaller pixel size. OMPS also offers SO 2 and other trace gas measurements but lacks spectral coverage in the violet-blue wavelength typically used for NO 2 retrievals. (Note: NO 2 observations are possible from OMPS, but they are less optimal as compared with OMI.) Image OMPS tracks the health of the ozone layer and measures the concentration of ozone and other aerosols in Earth's atmosphere. The instrument flies aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites and is scheduled to fly on the forthcoming JPSS-2, -3, and -4 satellite missions. ESA's GOME-2 instrument, which flies aboard its MetOp series satellites, and TROPOMI will become the primary sources for daily global hyperspectral observations of ozone and trace gases, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Credits: JPSS and ESA. In addition to OMPS, TROPOMI (the next generation instrument after OMI) was launched in 2017 aboard the European Sentinel-5P satellite, which circles Earth in an afternoon orbit slightly higher than Aura. Compared to OMI, TROPOMI has a higher spatial resolution (3.5 x 5.5 km 2 ) and a higher signal-to-noise ratio-per-ground pixel. It provides measurements of the same trace gases that can be monitored with OMI plus methane and carbon monoxide. TROPOMI's spectral requirements, calibration, and stability are about the same as OMI. These improvements are noteworthy, said Levelt, who is the scientific initiator of the TROPOMI instrument. “Regardless of TROPOMI's smaller pixel size, we get at least the same and up to five times more radiation depending on the wavelength,” she said. “Another big improvement is the addition of the oxygen bands to improve information about clouds. With the extra bands, we can get more parameters enabling us to determine cloud fraction, cloud height, surface albedo, and cloud albedo. The short-wave infrared channel (SWIR) that was added for carbon monoxide and methane monitoring is performing extremely well. The methane measurements are especially newsworthy, showing many methane sources, such as those from oil and gas exploration and landfills.” The TROPOMI mission has a seven-year lifespan, although it could remain in orbit much longer. ESA is planning three follow-on instruments, called Sentinel-5 /UVNS, that will be similar to TROPOMI with 7-km pixel size and an extra shortwave infrared channel. Sentinel-5/UVNS is the follow-up of the GOME-2 instrument and will fly in a morning, rather than afternoon, orbit. “We find ourselves in the position of going to a morning orbit with a similar spatial resolution and more spectral coverage, but we lose the afternoon orbit,” said Levelt, who is a member of ESA's Sentinel-4 and -5 Mission Advisory Group, which is planning three Sentinel-5 (TROPOMI-like) instruments over the next 20 years. She and her colleagues are aware that a potential gap in afternoon coverage could impact long-term data continuity after TROPOMI, especially for NO 2 and methane observations. Air quality scientists and modelers have expressed similar concern about the impact of losing early afternoon observations of trace gas satellite retrievals. In the morning, the boundary layer is not well mixed and resides mainly in the first few hundred meters above the surface. During the day the Sun warms the atmosphere and the boundary layer gets well-mixed, which makes interpretation and comparisons between modelling and measurements easier. Therefore, the best time to make NO 2 observations is in the early afternoon, as OMI and TROPOMI do. OMI-like spectrograph instruments are also being planned for inclusion on geostationary satellites, such as the Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution ( TEMPO ) mission, the Korean GEMS instrument, the European Sentinel-4 light imaging spectrometer instruments, and NOAA's GeoXO system . OMI-like sensors aboard these spacecraft would potentially give atmospheric scientists the opportunity to acquire measurements 8 to 10 times during the day and follow the diurnal cycle of air pollutants. To intercalibrate the geostationary TEMPO, GEMS, and Sentinel-4 satellites, it is also important to keep the afternoon orbit next to the morning orbit so that there are two points in the diurnal cycle to use in intercalibrating the GEO atmospheric measurements, instead of having only one point in the morning. New instruments aside, there's no question that the eventual end of OMI observations will result in a lot of work to create long-term data records that connect OMI data to that from OMPS and TROPOMI, as well as further back to the GOME and TOMS instruments. \"At the moment, when we see changes, we can compare them to what happened almost 20 years ago, thanks to the instrument being so stable,\" said Tamminen. \"It is not easy to simply put another satellite instrument up and expect it to work like OMI does now. We will need to figure out how to combine and how to continue reliable and consistent datasets from OMI though to the next generation instruments.\" Differences in instrument resolution and calibration among the instruments will need to be examined and accounted for to combine observations made in 2030 with those from 2010. Nevertheless, Tamminen is hopeful FMI will be able to develop long term records of UV index products extending from TOMS, through OMI, to TROPOMI in the hopes of achieving a 40-year record. OMPS data are already being used to advance the total ozone long-term data record that started with TOMS and continued with OMI. Even though OMPS has a larger footprint, the global total ozone data product is expected to be of similar quality. Long-term data records pertaining to trace gasses have proven more challenging, as the differences between the OMI and OMPS instruments are more significant. For now, Levelt advises OMI data users to begin working with OMPS and TROPOMI data while there is still a period of overlap. However, given the differences among products, users are advised to take care in determining which OMPS or TROPOMI data products are best for their application or research. Users can find the information on OMI, OMPS, and TROPOMI data products from NASA’s Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center ( GES DISC ) Distributed Active Archive Center ( DAAC ), which archives and distributes data from NASA's Earth-observing satellites and field measurement programs and provides services to users within the discipline communities. These services include providing complete documentation for available datasets as well as access to subject matter experts who can advise users on research needs, data applications, and accessing, viewing, and manipulating NASA Earth observing data. Products can be accessed as well through the EOSDIS Earthdata Search application by searching with keywords such as \"ozone.\" Image Users can find the information on OMI, OMPS, and TROPOMI data products from NASA’s GES DISC, which processes, archives, and distributes data from NASA's past and current Earth-observing satellites and field measurement programs. GES DISC also provides reliable services to users within the atmospheric data user community. Credit: NASA GES DISC. In addition, near real-time (NRT) OMI and NRT OMPS data products are available through the EOSDIS Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ). While NRT products do not have the extensive processing, quality assurance, or validation required for use in scientific research, they are available within three hours of a sensor observation and are an excellent resource for tracking on-going events or monitoring daily ozone concentrations. Experience with OMI and TROPOMI NRT data has found that the data quality is very good and these data are regularly used for scientific research. (OMI NRT data are also available from KNMI's TEMIS website .) \"OMI and OMPS science quality data products are available usually within 24 hours,\" says James Johnson, GES DISC Scientist for the OMI and OMPS missions. \"Right now, we are receiving Version 3 and the new Version 4 OMI products. Version 4 data is in a new format, netCDF4, which is designed to be compatible with TROPOMI (which is also in netCDF4) and make the transition easier.\" The OMI Version 4 Level 1B products —the calibrated radiances that are the inputs to trace gas retrieval algorithms—are nearly fully reprocessed and should be completed in the next month. Once completed, reprocessing to Level 2 and 3 products can begin. Version 3 is in an older format, but maintains the ability to process consistently from the start of the mission. According to Johnson, there is generally a good mapping between OMI and OMPS products, especially ozone, SO 2 , NO 2 , and aerosols. \"OMPS consists of multiple instruments, a nadir mapper similar to OMI and two vertical profilers on Suomi NPP, and just one vertical profiler on NOAA-20, each with products archived by GES DISC,\" he said. \"In addition, NASA scientists and researchers generate products that combine instrument data from multi-satellites that are also archived by GES DISC. With product names and titles somewhat similar, this can make it confusing to know which products are suitable for your application or research. GES DISC has been developing guidance information and is available to help.\" TROPOMI data are available from ESA's Copernicus Open Access Hub , and through GES DISC, courtesy of an agreement wherein NASA assists with archiving and distributing the instrument's data. A limited amount of TROPOMI L2 NRT data can also be found within three hours after an observation on the TEMIS website. \"NASA's Sentinel Gateway facility retrieves TROPOMI products from ESA and sends the products to the GES DISC,\" said Dr. Feng Ding, GES DISC Data System Engineer specializing in TROPOMI data and services. \"Products are normally available within two to three days of observation.\" ESA released the first TROPOMI ozone profile product on November 16, 2021. Users can access it through the GES DISC website, get it through GES DISC data downloading and subsetting services, and display it with popular visualization tools. \"The best way to find and download these data products is go to the GES DISC website or Earthdata Search, which provides users with product lists, landing pages, and documentation, including data resolution and data coverage information,\" said Ding. Ding also advises users to review the product documentation that GES DISC provides along with any updates, as they may offer important information about changes to the data. For example, ESA changed the instrument's operating configuration in August 2019 to start taking higher-resolution measurements. As of August 6, 2022, there are new versions of the mission's data products. To combine the observations for a long-term record, researchers will need to update data processing to account for the change. As Johnson's and Ding's statements suggest, efforts to extend OMI's 18-year data record to the next generation of instruments are well underway. As they continue, and as scientists find new ways to use and benefit from OMI's long-term observations, the instrument's legacy of helping scientists characterize and identify long-term atmospheric trends in the interest of public health and clean air will live on.

Jan 30, 2023 Lori Schultz, Research Physical Scientist and NASA Disasters Program Center Coordinator; NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center Image Lori Schultz is a research physical scientist and Disasters program area center coordinator at Marshall. Credit: Lori Schultz. Research Interests: Finding novel ways to use satellite remote sensing data to answer scientific questions, developing decision-support systems that incorporate NASA Earth science data to meet the needs of users, and applying satellite data to disaster monitoring and mitigation, including the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect and monitor flood and landslide risk. Research Highlights: Without the international constellation of satellites that provide data and imagery of Earth every hour of every day, Lori Schultz, research physical scientist with NASA’s Applied Sciences Program and Center Coordinator of the Disasters program area at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, wouldn’t be able to do her job. Yet, if you talk with Schultz about her work in any detail, she’ll tell you she spends most of her time addressing more human-oriented, down-to-Earth concerns. “I spend a lot of time learning about everyone else’s job and then trying to understand where the data we have to offer fit, or don’t fit, such as the case may be,” said Schultz. “One of the things about working in the applied sciences is that everyone uses data in a slightly different way, so it’s about trying to understand how data are going to work for a particular group.” Schultz describes her work as “finding ways to use satellite remote sensing data to answer science questions,” which is a characterization that supports the NASA Applied Sciences Program's mission to use NASA's unique view from space to address real-world issues. The Applied Sciences Program, which is part of NASA's Earth Science Division , uses global observations from space, air, sea, and land to help people the world over better understand the planet’s interconnected systems. Through its eight program areas —agriculture, capacity building, climate resilience, disasters, ecological conservation, health and air quality, water resources, and wildland fire—the Applied Sciences Program provides funding and support to NASA’s partner organizations (at the state, regional, national, or international levels) who use these observations in response to some of the world’s toughest challenges. As coordinator of the Disasters program area , Schultz and the Marshall team often act as satellite data interpreters who assist personnel from response agencies that reach out to NASA for information and observations in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. In those moments, Schultz and her colleagues review the satellite data and imagery at their disposal to see how these resources might support recovery efforts and how her team can serve as liaisons to those leading response activities on the ground. “If we’re working with [response personnel] during an event, they’ll ask a question and it’s our job to go find the data that answer that question,” said Schultz. “They don’t ask, do you have this? They say, 'I really need to know this.' It’s my job is to have enough knowledge of a lot of different remote sensing applications so, hopefully, we can give them the information they need.” Schultz readily admits that no one dataset is ever going to have all the answers a user is looking for, which is why understanding the work these data users do and the questions they’re trying to answer is so vital to her work. “It’s important to have a relationship with these users, because it helps to know what it is they know and what other data they’re using, and how data we provide could be exploited,” she said. “Sometimes you can’t directly see something, such as a particular area or feature, so a dataset might not give them the exact answer they want. But then we might be able to use four or five datasets to give them more confidence that they’re making the right decision.” Image These before-and-after images show Hurricane Michael's impact on the Gulf Coast of Florida between October 9 and 11, 2019. If you follow along the hurricane’s northeasterly track, you can see that many nighttime lights disappeared after the storm (bottom image). Larger images are available on the Disasters Mapping Portal . Credit: NASA Applied Sciences Program. To help users make those decisions, Schultz and her colleagues rely on a variety of NASA Earth science data, including near real-time ( NRT ) data from NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ). LANCE generates and distributes NRT data and imagery, the majority of which are available within three hours of satellite observation, to support users interested in monitoring a wide variety of natural and human-created phenomena. “The speed with which LANCE distributes its datasets is absolutely spectacular,” said Schultz. “As soon as it becomes available in LANCE, our team here at the Marshall Space Flight Center can process it into products our stakeholders can use and distribute it to them. That’s an amazing thing. As the datasets are usually in science formats, there is some work for the Disasters program team to provide them through the Disasters portal in a user-ready format, but NASA DAACs [Distributed Active Archive Centers] and LANCE are moving in that direction more and more, as exemplified by the FIRMS [NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management] website. It is very encouraging to be part of expanding the use of NASA data to a broader audience.\" In fact, in addition to her work with the Applied Sciences Program, Schultz serves as a member of the LANCE User Working Group ( UWG ), which provides recommendations concerning a broad range of topics related to LANCE systems, capabilities, and services. In this role, she has the opportunity to assist LANCE as it works to enhance and expand its NRT data offerings. Schultz regularly uses the NRT imagery available in NASA Worldview and FIRMS to give stakeholders a sense of both the information different NASA datasets provide and how data from multiple sources might be used together. “I frequently use Worldview to demonstrate a particular dataset and let stakeholders see what it shows over a particular period of time so they can see if information it provides is useful or valuable to them,” Schultz said. “I’ve used the FIRMS webpage a lot because I love how it offers a variety of optical data, and I can use it to show how data from several sources can be layered.” Among the datasets Schultz and her team in the Disasters program use most frequently are true-color imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) instrument aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System spacecraft, and reflectance imagery from the Operational Land Imager ( OLI ) aboard the joint NASA/ USGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites and the Multi-Spectral Instrument ( MSI ) aboard the ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. “MODIS and VIIRS are workhorses for big-picture looks, barring any cloud cover,” Schultz said. “Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B and Landsat 8 and 9 are also right up there, as we get to take advantage of their 30-meter resolution, despite the tradeoff of not getting a look every day.” Schultz and Disasters program staff also regularly use MODIS Global Flood Products, which provide daily global flood maps based on MODIS imagery; VIIRS Day/Night band imagery, which is ultra-sensitive in low-light conditions and enables observations of nighttime lights—information that is useful for gauging the impact of and recovery from severe weather; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets from MODIS and VIIRS, which provide information on vegetation health that farmers and resource managers can use to monitor the health and development of crops and fields during growing seasons; and SAR data from Sentinel-1 and other space-based and airborne sources. Unlike optical data from instruments like MODIS and VIIRS, SAR uses the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, so it can penetrate cloud cover and \"see” in the dark and through inclement weather conditions, thereby enabling observations of flood inundation, land cover changes, and modifications of Earth's surface from earthquakes and landslides. Image As part of her work, Schultz frequently trains personnel from first response teams on integrating Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) data products into their workflow. Credit: Lori Schultz. In 2021, Schultz and her Disaster’s program colleagues worked with personnel from public health and safety agencies in North Carolina to demonstrate how datasets like these can help the state respond to and even prepare for disasters during North Carolina’s annual hurricane exercise. It was not the first time the Disasters program worked with North Carolina’s emergency response teams. A year earlier, in November 2020, the state’s emergency managers reached out to the Disasters program to better understand how NASA satellite data could help determine floodwater extent in the aftermath of Hurricane Eta, which flooded roads, damaged infrastructure, and led to the deaths of at least four people. In response, Schultz and her team developed false-color maps of the region that enabled officials to pinpoint the buildings and roads most at risk in the days before flood levels reached their peak. Having worked with the state's emergency teams before, Schultz and her colleagues knew the state had extensive flood monitoring capabilities. So, during the hurricane exercise, Schultz and her team focused their efforts on showing state employees how NASA satellite data could help them more quickly and accurately assess the amount and location of flooding. “The public safety agencies are the experts in emergency response , but they can’t be expected to be experts in all of our satellite data,” Schultz noted in an article on the Applied Sciences website about the Disaster program area’s participation in the exercise. “We learned they have tremendous modeling and remote sensing capabilities, but could use NASA’s help to use satellite data to find flooding. So, we built a flood mapping portal for them to use during the exercise to demonstrate what’s possible.” Providing such insights before severe weather occurs is important, for when disaster strikes there’s no time to wonder what type of information might be helpful to those directing first responders in the field. Further, as climate change continues to increase the frequency and severity of storms, North Carolina and other states in the Southeastern United States can expect to experience more floods in the coming years. So, too, can places in other flood-prone regions of the world, such as the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region of India, where hydro-climatic disasters in the form of seasonal, riverine, and flash floods occur frequently along the rivers and tributaries during monsoon season. Every year, destructive floods result in the loss of lives and livelihoods and cause severe damage to infrastructure and property, but because the region’s floods cannot be totally controlled, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ( ICIMOD ) has directed its response efforts toward reducing flood vulnerability and mitigating flood impacts through improved flood risk management and end-to-end flood forecasting and warning services. To assist ICIMOD in meeting these goals, Schultz worked with members of a SERVIR Applied Sciences Team led by Dr. Franz Meyer, Chief Scientist at the Alaska Satellite Facility , on a three-year project to develop a flood inundation portal. Using SAR data from the Sentinel-1 satellite, the portal documents the location and extent of floods caused by the latest monsoons—timely and accurate information local agencies can use to inform their flood relief activities. (Note: The SERVIR Applied Sciences Team is part of the larger SERVIR network, which is a joint development initiative of the United States Agency for International Development and NASA.) “We used SAR data in the Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region because there are so many clouds and they really can’t use the standard optical data to see how the water in their region is changing,” said Schultz. Image This image from the ICIMOD Flood Inundation Mapping portal shows the extent of flooding during monsoon season in the HKH region. Dark blue colors indicate perennial water bodies; light blue colors indicate areas of flooding. Credit: SERVIR. “Now the team at ICIMOD is beginning to use these data to validate forecast models that were developed before the project began, track how the water is moving through the area during monsoon season, and identify areas that are more at risk,\" Schultz said. While such results are certainly good news for the people of the HKH region, the SERVIR project’s success in applying SAR data to flooding applications appears to be benefitting emergency response efforts in the U.S. as well. “We applied the same algorithms that we used in the HKH region to detect floods after hurricanes that hit the East Coast,” said Schultz. “I’ve made maps of flooding from Hurricane Ian and Nicole with SAR data using these same techniques, and I was able to get them to [the] Federal Emergency Management Agency within three hours of getting the data.” As these advances suggest, the free and open Earth science data available through NASA’s LANCE and the DAACs are essential for not only providing disaster response organizations with the information they need to safeguard human life and critical infrastructure, they are key inputs in the development of new technologies and techniques that scientists like Schultz, humanitarian organizations, and government agencies will use to improve the detection, response, and mitigation of natural disasters the world over.

The AMSU-A2 comprises two microwave channels: 23.8 GHz and 31.4 GHz. The function of these channels is to identify precipitation and correct for surface emissivity, cloud liquid water and water vapor effects in the AIRS/AMSU retrieval algorithm. Since then, the AIRS retrieval product is generated by AIRS IR only algorithm. More information on AMSU-A state . AMSR2 NRT Data Outages and Known Issues Known Issue: NRT AMSR2 Daily L3 Global Snow Water Equivalent EASE-Grids JAXA's NRT L1R brightness temperature data are supplied to us in \"nearly-orbit\" files. Unlike the standard products, the data in these files usually doesn't start or end exactly at the north pole. We process these data in the form in which we receive them by splitting them into descending and ascending \"half-orbit\" files at the south pole inflection point. Therefore, there may be extra or missing data at the beginning of the descending half-orbit and at the end of the ascending half-orbit. Improved latency for the near real time L1R data means that AMSR2 LANCE products are consistently available within the target time period of three hours from observation. However, because the AMSR2 snow product is generated only from the descending passes, when data are missing at the beginning of the descending half-orbit, that data will be missing from the resulting snow product and corresponding imagery as well.

The NRT fire data are replaced with data extracted from the standard MCD14ML Active Fire / Thermal Anomalies locations (vector data) as they become available, usually after 2 months, from the FIRMS Active Fire Download Tool , or from the University of Maryland MODIS Fire and Burned Area Products website . LANCE processes data as soon as they are downlinked from satellites or transmitted from ground stations, generally within 30 minutes to two hours after satellite observation. Routines used to derive Level 2 products, such as fire, snow, and sea ice products, do not make use of ancillary data and therefore their codes are identical to the ones used in standard operations. The difference between MODIS geolocation when using definitive vs. predicted attitude and ephemeris is routinely less than 100 meters. However, there are situations, particularly before and after spacecraft maneuvers and during space weather events, when the difference can increase up to several kilometers. The recommendation from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System ( EOSDIS ) is to utilize the standard product data, which are reprocessed using the definitive attitude and ephemeris data. Known Issues MCD14DL are NRT products and may be subject to geo-location errors or reprocessing. The MODIS NRT product uses predicted rather than the definitive attitude and ephemeris used by MCD14ML (Standard Product) Active Fire / Thermal Anomalies locations (available with a 3-month lag). The difference between the NRT and standard product versions of the product is routinely less than 100 meters; however, there are situations, particularly before and after spacecraft maneuvers and during space weather events, when the difference can increase up to several kilometers.

The clouds over land show sensitivity to different GDAS ancillary input data. Science quality, or higher-level “standard” data products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earth’s geophysical properties to support science. They are made available within 8-40 hours of satellite observation. If latency is not a primary concern, users are encouraged to use the standard science products, which are created using the best available ancillary, calibration and ephemeris information. Standard products corresponding to the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) (LANCE) near real-time (NRT) products are archived as follows: AIRS and MLS standard products are available through NASA's Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center ( GES DISC ). AMSR SIPS generates AMSR2 standard science quality data products and they are available at NASA's National Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center ( NSIDC DAAC ). Lightning Imaging Sensor on ISS (ISS LIS) standard products are available from NASA’s Global Hydrometeorology Resource Center DAAC ( GHRC DAAC ) Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer ( MISR ) standard products are available from NASA's Atmospheric Sciences Data Center ( ASDC ). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) standard atmosphere and L1 products are available through NASA's Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) DAAC ( LAADS DAAC ). MODIS standard land products are available from NASA's Land Processes DAAC ( LP DAAC ) and NSIDC DAAC (snow and ice). OMI standard products are available through GES DISC. OMPS standard products are available through GES DISC. VIIRS land products standard are available from LP DAAC and NSIDC DAAC (snow and ice). VIIRS-Atmosphere standard products are available through NASA's Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center ( LAADS DAAC ) via NASA's Suomi NPP Land SIPS . Comparisons Between the NRT and Standard Products AIRS NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS ) NRT data products are identical to the AIRS routine products except for the following. The AIRS NRT products are produced: The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes (previous and subsequent granules are used for calibration and are generally present in 5 minutes). Predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used (in contrast, definitive ephemeris/attitude data are used for processing standard products). Nominally, a forecast surface pressure is used; if this is unavailable, a surface climatology is then used. No ice cloud properties retrievals are performed (ice cloud properties are a new retrieval in the Version 6 support product AIRX2SUP ). These differences have the following implications for the AIRS NRT Level 1B and Level 2 products. Level 1B - The atmospheric surface pressure is not used in Level 1B processing, the AIRS Level 1b radiance data produced in the NRT system are nearly identical to the routinely processed AIRS data. There may be small differences in the geolocation (i.e., longitude and latitude). Also, since the NRT system does not wait as long for the previous or subsequent granule data to be present before processing there may be small differences in the radiances of NRT data that were processed without the previous or subsequent granules. This can happen when AIRS is entering or leaving the range of a downlink station (usually are 17 times/day). The reason for the differences is because the standard product uses the space view offset from the previous and subsequent granules for calibration purposes. Level 2 - The AIRS Level 2 NRT retrieval products can differ from the routine products because of small differences in assumed surface pressure and/or differences in the radiances. Although it is rare, if the forecast surface pressure is not available when the NRT data are produced the NRT algorithm assumes a surface pressure based on a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) rather than the more accurate forecast surface pressure. The differences in the assumed surface pressure tend to be small (~ 10 mbar) near the equator but can become larger (~ 70 mbar) near synoptic weather events. The pressure differences can also lead to differences in the retrieved temperature and water vapor. For more information, please read the following document, AIRS NRT data products: May 10, 2010 , describing the difference between AIRS NRT and Standard Products. Back to top AMSR2 NRT The LANCE system provides access to near real-time data (less than 3 hours from observation). Users, operational agencies and researchers utilize these products for a wide range of purposes (weather forecasting to monitoring natural hazards). These users often need data much sooner than routine science processing allows and are willing to trade science quality for timely access. Science quality products should be used for latency independent research and applications. The AMSR SIPS generates AMSR2 standard science quality data products and they are available at NSIDC DAAC. Back to top LIS NRT (ISS) Near real-time (NRT), non-quality controlled (NQC) standard data products, and quality controlled (QC) standard data products from the LIS (ISS) are available from NASA's Global Hydrometeorology Resource Center ( GHRC DAAC ) and the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ) system. These data are available in both HDF-4 and netCDF-4 formats, with corresponding browse images in GIF format. LANCE LIS (ISS) NRT data are available rapidly after an observation (generally within two minutes), and are an excellent resource for applications requiring low data latency, such as tracking on-going severe storms or tracking lightning over oceans and other data-sparse regions. Standard data products, on the other hand, are created daily after all raw observations for the day have been acquired and are more complete than NRT data. The LIS (ISS) Quality Controlled (QC) standard data products have extensive processing, quality assurance reviews, and validation and should be used in scientific research. Back to top MISR NRT Differences between MISR Level 1 NRT Radiances and Level 1 Standard Products MISR Level 1 NRT radiance products contain the same content as the standard products. However, changes were made to the code to allow the L1 processing to deal with the session-based MISR L0 data and the Terra attitude data that goes along with this L0 data. Level 1 Near Real-Time The MISR NRT Level 1 data products consist of radiance measurements organized in 10-50 minute sessions representing a portion of a single MISR orbit. Measurements are obtained throughout the 380 km MISR swath and projected onto a Space-Oblique Mercator (SOM) map grid. The Ellipsoid-projected and Terrain-projected top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance products provide measurements respectively resampled onto the WGS84 reference ellipsoid and onto the topography of a digital elevation model. Spatial sampling is 275 m in all bands of MISR’s nadir camera, and in the red band of the other eight (off-nadir) cameras. The remaining channels are sampled at 1.1 km. Level 2 Near Real-Time MISR Level 2 NRT Products are geophysical measurements derived in near real time from Level 1 NRT products. MISR Level 2 NRT Cloud Motion Vector (CMV) datasets are distributed as BUFR and HDF format files within 3 hours of satellite overflight. Product data is organized in 10-50 minute sessions representing a portion of a single MISR orbit. Parameters are projected onto a SOM map grid and defined throughout the 380 km wide MISR swath. At present, available Level 2 NRT products include two formats of the MISR Level 2 CMV product, comprising height-resolved cloud motions representative of the wind field. The CMV product is analogous to the MISR Level 3 CMV product offered in standard production. MISR BUFR format files have been verified to be compatible with the ECMWF BUFRDC 000400 library and the NCEP BUFRLIB v10-2-3 library. Differences between MISR Level 2 NRT CMV and Level 3 Standard Products MISR Level 2 NRT CMV products are intended to contain nearly equivalent science information as L3 MISR CMV product files produced with monthly and seasonal file granularity. The cloud-tracking and reconstruction algorithms of each are equivalent, except for the following details: Whereas the L3 CMV product includes in the product only wind speeds up to speeds of 50 ms-1, the Level 2 NRT CMV product includes wind speeds up to 100 ms-1. Wind speeds greater than 50 ms-1 were originally excluded from the L3 CMV product because they can only be obtained for wind orientations aligned with the ground track of the satellite. The potential sampling bias associated with this limitation is less relevant for rapid response applications. For data sessions in which fewer than 1000 valid retrievals are obtained prior to quality filtering, all retrievals will be omitted on the basis that insufficient data is available to perform necessary checks on the accuracy of camera pointing information. Level 2 NRT CMV products provide a nominal 75% of the coverage provided by Level 3 CMV products. Level 3 CMV product datasets are distributed as NetCDF format files comprising data collected over the course of a month, season, or year. Level 2 NRT CMVs are derived from data sessions typically comprising less than the full orbit employed by standard process. Level 2 NRT CMV product datasets are generated by a separate implementation of the same algorithms used for standard products that yields nearly equivalent results. Differences are due to the nature of NRT processing and fall within the expected uncertainty of the retrieval. For more information about Level 2 CMVs, please read section 2 of the following document, JPL D-74995 Data Product Specification for the MISR Cloud Motion Vector Product . Additional information about the difference between the MISR NRT and standard products is available in the Data Quality Summary for L2 CMV NRT Product and L3 CMV Product . Differences between MISR Level 2 NRT Aerosols and Level 2 Standard Products A paper that describes the development of the new NRT aerosol product and summarizes the differences between the NRT and the standard aerosol products has been accepted for publication in the journal Atmospheric Measurement Techniques and is available at https://amt.copernicus.org/preprints/amt-2021-71/ . The MISR NRT aerosol products contain information on atmospheric aerosols, including optical depth, single scattering albedo, Angstrom exponent, and aerosol size. The MISR NRT retrieval strategy builds upon the MISR standard aerosol algorithm. NRT employs the same ancillary datasets as the initial FIRSTLOOK version of the standard product that is available within 2 days from acquisition. The key difference between the standard and NRT processing is in cloud screening: the NRT algorithm does not have access to cloud classifiers that are available in the standard algorithm, and which are generated during Level 1 and Level 2 cloud processing. As a result, in the NRT algorithm, a threshold on the Aerosol Retrieval Confidence Index (ARCI) was adjusted to 0.18; the equivalent ARCI threshold in the FIRSTLOOK and standard processing is 0.15. Information about this product and details about product quality are available on the MISR Data and Information Table. Back to top MLS NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. For detailed information on MLS NRT data product quality, please see the user guide. The MLS NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet NRT data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products. Nevertheless the results are scientifically useful in selected regions of the earth's atmosphere provided that the data are screened according to the recommendations in the MLS NRT user guide. The NRT data are typically available within 3 hours of observation and are broken into files containing about 15 minutes of data. The 7 most recent days of MLS NRT data are kept online for users to download. After this time users should download the standard, full production Level-2 data products. Back to top MODIS NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. Near Real-Time Approach The delivery of the Level 0 (L0) is expedited from the EOS Data and Operations System (EDOS). NRT processing acquires L0 files at the end of each downlink session (session-based files) within 10-30 minutes of real-time, whereas standard forward processing acquires 2-hour L0 files for Aqua and Terra within 7-8 hours of real-time. For geolocation MODIS Terra and MODIS Aqua differ in their approach. For MODIS Terra the attitude and ephemeris data entrained in the L0 data are used rather than the flight data (FD) product for standard processing. The Aqua sensor (unlike Terra) lacks the ability to generate definitive ephemeris and attitude data, and therefore, NASA's Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) calculates predicted satellite ephemeris data and uploads it to the spacecraft once per day. This data is later returned to the ground stations as Ground-Based Attitude Determination (GBAD) data, which is also time-coordinated with the other instruments. This GBAD ephemeris and attitude data is used to process Aqua MODIS standard products. Most NRT Product Generation Executive (PGE) codes use the same science algorithm used in the standard processing. However, certain Level 2 (L2) codes have modified production rules to relax the requirements for ancillary data products. For Level 3, rolling products such as MOD141N/Q1N, MxD09A1N, MCD43A1N/A2/A2N download this PDF to explain the differences between the NRT and standard \"n-day\" products. Image In this side-by-side comparison of a standard and near-real time Land Surface Reflectance granule over the Midwest there appears to be no difference between the products. However, under close examination the near-real time view shows slightly more haze West of the Great Lakes. To meet the latency requirement, most L2 NRT Atmosphere PGEs (Cloud Mask/Profile, Cloud, and Aerosol) are allowed to use ancillary input products (e.g. GDAS, NISE, OZONE, TOAST) from an earlier time period, and sometime even several days prior to the current data day while the operational processing could be delayed until the best ancillary data is available. Use of ancillaries from different data days can result in significant difference in the daily cloud and aerosol product generated at NRT compared to the operational products from MODAPS. The L2 Fire, Snow, and Sea Ice from NRT are nearly identical to the operational product as these PGEs do not make use of ancillary data products. A special version of the L2 Land Surface Reflectance for near real-time use was developed by the Principal Investigator (PI); this code uses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Forecast System (GFS) ancillary product as opposed to Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) used in the standard processing version. Difference in L2 surface reflectance product from this change to processing code in NRT processing isn’t significant. Image MODIS Cloud top tempurature over the Midwest. Thin clouds over Lake Superior show sensitivity to GDAS ancillary data. The near real-time PGE codes were extensively science tested and all products were compared to the baseline products generated by the standard processing. This comparison was made by the atmosphere and land Quality Assessment (QA) (Land Data Operational Products Evaluation [ LDOPE ]) staff and by the PIs. All PGEs have been validated for use in LANCE-MODIS by the PIs. This process will be repeated as new versions of the PGEs become available and are considered for inclusion in LANCE-MODIS. Side by Side Comparison Two examples of side-by-side comparisons of the standard and near real-time products are shown here. The first shows a Land Surface Reflectance granule over the Midwest. There appears to be no difference between the products. However, under close examination the near real-time view shows slightly more haze West of the Great Lakes. In contrast, the second side-by-side comparison is for Cloud Top Temperature for the same granule and there are very obvious differences in the region West of the Great Lakes. This is as a result of the sensitivity of this product to the GDAS ancillary data. Back to top MOPITT NRT The MOPITT NRT Product (NRT) differs from the Standard Product (SP) in the following ways: The SP uses NASA's GMAO MERRA-2 reanalysis data to estimate the meteorological conditions, such as water vapor and temperature profiles. The NRT uses MERRA-2 forecasts. The SP uses MODIS cloud masks to filter out cloudy pixels. The NRT uses MOPITT thermal channels compared with the expected radiance from surface in order to discriminate clear from cloudy pixels. SP products are daily files, whereas NRT files are released as soon as they are processed. The granule size varies depending on the input files that are received. SP are inspected for QA to ensure consistency with validated granules. NRT files undergo automatic QA which will alert the processing team if there are any anomalies. Level 2 SP files are further processing to create daily and monthly Level 3 products. NRT files remain at Level 2. SP are regularly delivered to the ASDC for archive and distribution. NRT products are not archived and are distributed from NCAR servers. OMI NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. The quality of OMI NRT Level 2 products compares favorably to the standard products. There appears to be some variances at high latitudes with high solar zenith angles. In the following table we display the maximum differences for a single day and averaged over a week. Product Variable Daily Maximum Percentage Difference Weekly Average Maximum Percentage Difference OMTO3 Total Ozone Column 2.64% 1.40% OMCLDRR Cloud Fraction 6.02% 1.42% Cloud Pressure 2.82% 0.67% OMAERUV AOD (388 nm) 5.95% 2.31% Back to top OMPS NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. The quality of OMPS NRT Level 2 products compares favorably to the standard products. There appears to be some variances at high latitudes with high solar zenith angles. In the following table we display the maximum differences for a single day and averaged over a week. NMTO3-L2 and NPBUVO3-L2 The science team has not found any large difference in the quality of the products, a more detailed analysis will be provided in the near future. A comparison between Near Real-Time SNPP/OMPS PCA SO2 product and the Standard SNPP/OMPS PCA SO2 product In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets for the SNPP/OMPS principal component analysis (PCA) SO2 product (NMSO2-PCA-L2). In general, the near real-time (NRT) SNPP/OMPS PCA SO2 product is very similar to the standard processing product. On average, the differences between the NRT and standard SO2 products are 0.03 DU (Dobson Units) or less. Note that under most circumstances, the actual SO2 loading in the atmosphere is very small, and the percentage difference would be significant even for a very small absolute difference. There are stripes (or rows) with relative large differences between the NRT and the standard products, especially for high latitudes or the edge of the swath. This is likely due to the setup of the PCA retrieval algorithm, in which principal components (PCs) are extracted from the input radiance data for each cross-track position (row) of the each OMPS orbit. The PCs are then used in spectral fitting for all pixels in the same row. Differences in the input radiance and other input data may lead to different PCs and also different number of PCs that are actually used in the spectral fitting, resulting in relatively large differences for some rows. The table below summarizes the differences between NRT and standard SNPP/OMPS PCA SO2 products. Parameter Max Difference (DU)* Mean Difference (DU)** SO2_PBL (total column amount assuming all SO2 near the surface) 1.3 0.027 SO2_TRL (total column amount assuming 3-km SO2 plume height) 1.2 0.022 SO2_TRM (total column amount assuming 8-km SO2 plume height) 0.6 0.013 SO2_TRU (total column amount assuming 13-km SO2 plume height) 0.4 <0.01 SO2_STL (total column amount assuming 18-km SO2 plume height) 0.3 <0.01 *The maximum of the absolute difference between NRT and standard products for one day (10/09/2017). *The mean of the absolute difference between NRT and standard products for one day (10/09/2017). VIIRS Land NRT In order to generate data products within 3 hours of observation time, a number of changes have been made to standard processing approach to expedite the availability of input data sets. NRT processing uses session based L0 files acquired at the end of each downlink session within 10-30 minutes of real-time, delivered by the EOS Data and Operations System (EDOS), whereas standard forward processing acquires 2-hour L0 files (time based) within 7-8 hours of real-time. For geolocation NRT uses definitive orbit information similar to the operational processing. However there could be still minor difference in the geolocation due to difference in certain other ancillary products used by the geolocation processing such as polar wander files. Error introduced by use of such difference ancillaries is minor, but in some situations this position error may be large (several kilometers). In particular, the larger errors may occur after spacecraft maneuvers. Impacted time period may vary from ~30 minutes in case of lunar calibration roll maneuver to ~ 2hrs in case of an inclination maneuver. In these cases users are advised to use the standard product generated using the best available satellite position data and after the quality assurance team has reviewed and removed data degraded by spacecraft maneuver. L1B and most L2 products use the same algorithm and LUTs as used by the operational processing except for difference in some of ancillary. For example Land cloud mask processing might use NISE data from a prior data day if the data is not available for the current day processing resulting in minor difference in land cloud mask product and downstreams. Similarly there could be significant difference in retrieved LST (could be as large as 5 deg K) from use of NCEP at NRT as opposed to the MERRA2 used by the standard processing for water vapor input. For Level 3, rolling products download this PDF to explain the differences between the NRT and standard \"n-day\" products. VIIRS Atmosphere NRT In order to generate near real-time (NRT) VIIRS Atmosphere products within 3 hours of observation time, several changes have been made to the standard processing approach. These differences are outlined as follows. NRT processing utilizes session-based L0 files ingested by the Atmosphere SIPS from the EOS Data and Operations System (EDOS) available within 1 – 2 hours of real-time. Standard forward stream processing uses time-based L0 files ingested within 5 - 7 hours of real-time. For geolocation, NRT uses definitive orbit information similar to the operational processing. However, there could be still minor difference in the geolocation due to difference in ancillary products used by the geolocation processing such as polar wander files or the geolocation LUT files. Error introduced by use of such difference ancillaries is typically minor, but in some situations this position error may be large (several kilometers). Larger errors may occur after spacecraft maneuvers. Impacted time period may vary from ~30 minutes in case of lunar calibration roll maneuver to ~ 2hrs in case of an inclination maneuver. In these cases users are advised to use the standard product generated using the best available satellite position data and after the quality assurance team has reviewed and removed data degraded by spacecraft maneuver. The Standard Forward Stream Processing Mode creates the best possible global VIIRS Level 1B and Atmosphere products using the highest fidelity input data sources, including (but not limited to) retransmitted Level 0 data from EDOS; calibration lookup tables (LUTs) from offline analysis by the NASA VIIRS Characterization Support Team; and final versions of ancillary data from external providers (e.g. LAADS, UCAR, NCDC, etc.). The philosophy for these products is to wait until the best input data are available, and then create the best possible VIIRS Level 1B, VIIRS Atmosphere Level 2, and Level 3 products. The Near Real-Time Processing Mode creates low latency global VIIRS Level 1B and Atmosphere Level 2 products, within the constraints imposed by the time delay in receiving the session-based VIIRS L0 files. The philosophy for the NRT products is to provide rapid turnaround to Science Team members and other investigators who require the VIIRS Atmosphere products in near real-time. The VIIRS L1B/L2 products are created using the same or similar algorithms used to create the Standard Forward Stream Mode products, however the calibration LUTs and ancillary data available at the time the Level 0 data are received are used. For NRT production, ancillary input products (e.g. NISE) from an earlier time period, and sometime even several days prior, may be used, while standard mode operational processing may be delayed until the best ancillary data is available. For example, the VIIRS MVCM Cloud Mask NRT product uses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Forecast System (GFS) ancillary product as opposed to the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) product used in the standard processing version. The VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol NRT product utilizes the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) model forecasts instead of the reanalysis product. In addition, the Deep Blue product implements a different QA flag (QA flag Ocean = 2) for the NRT product associated with the effects of GEOS-5 wind speed on AOD retrievals over oceans in regions near sun glint.

Here’s a look at 10 LANCE milestones over the past decade. author-share Joshua C. Blumenfeld Oct 30, 2019 Since 2009, the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS), or LANCE , has been providing data and data products generally within three hours of a satellite observation. The products, services, and data distribution strategies developed by the LANCE team have helped transform not only how Earth observing data are used, but also the worldwide accessibility of these data. As LANCE enters its second decade, it’s worth looking back at 10 LANCE milestones. While this list is not meant to be all-inclusive, it provides an overview of how this major initiative evolved to provide data from instruments aboard Earth observing satellites rapidly, accurately, and consistently. 1. Development of the NRTPE and Rapid Response, the precursors to LANCE The evolution of what would become known as LANCE began in 2001 with the development of the NASA/NOAA/Department of Defense Near Real-Time Processing Effort (NRTPE). At the request of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), NASA’s Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project collaborated with the USFS and the University of Maryland Department of Geography to create a system called Rapid Response using the NRTPE feed as a foundation. Rapid Response provided access to near real-time imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua Earth observing satellites to support wildfire suppression and response. 2. Establishment of LANCE in 2009 By 2008, a growing demand for near real-time data spurred a NASA Headquarters-led effort to build a new, more robust system to process and distribute near real-time data. In July 2009, the ESDIS Project led the development of a new near real-time system serving data from not only the MODIS instrument, but also the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard NASA’s Aqua satellite, the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard NASA’s Aura satellite, and, soon afterward, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) aboard Aqua. This new system was formally established by NASA in September 2009 and named “LANCE.” 3. User/Community Feedback Mechanisms Established In December 2009 the ESDIS Project held a workshop to better understand the needs of LANCE users and to nominate the first members of a new LANCE User Working Group (UWG). This advisory group provides guidance and recommendations concerning topics related to the LANCE system, capabilities, and services and represents the needs of the LANCE applications user communities. The ESDIS Project conducted an informal survey of LANCE users in 2012 to better understand user needs and solicit feedback on improvements to better serve near real-time applications. Formal user surveys were conducted in 2013 and 2016. 4. Rapid Response Integrated with LANCE in 2011 After its establishment in 2001, Rapid Response remained a stand-alone system. Between 2004 and 2011, new MODIS spectral band combinations were implemented to enhance snow/ice, floods, and burn scars. Recognizing the importance of near real-time imagery for users who lived in areas with low internet bandwidth service, the MODIS Rapid Response system was incorporated into LANCE in February 2011. The Rapid Response system was phased out in 2019 and replaced with Worldview Snapshots . 5. The Development of GIBS and NASA Worldview Powered by LANCE (2011) Image Screenshot of the first Worldview test home page on December 3, 2011. NASA Worldview image. MODIS Rapid Response demonstrated not only the ability to provide near real-time imagery, but also the value of quick and simple access to this imagery. The next step in LANCE’s development was the creation of a way for data users to easily download near real-time imagery, interactively explore this imagery, and download the underlying data behind this imagery. The results of these efforts were the development of the LANCE-powered Global Imagery Browse Services ( GIBS ) and the NASA Worldview interactive data visualization application in 2011. GIBS and NASA Worldview were game-changers in the way near real-time imagery were distributed and used, and provided users with quick and easy access to daily, global imagery in near real-time. 6. Development of FIRMS Image Each orange dot on this FIRMS Fire Map from October 30, 2019, indicates a MODIS-detected hotspot, which may be a wildfire. NASA FIRMS image. The Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ), initially developed at the University of Maryland, was transitioned to LANCE in May 2010, and became formally operational in LANCE in May 2012. FIRMS provides near real-time thermal anomaly data (including an approximate location of a detected hotspot) from the MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments. Global active fire detections can be viewed interactively using the FIRMS Fire Map application, and FIRMS users can sign up to receive email Fire Alerts notifying them of potential fires detected in specific areas of interest. Through this free service, alerts can be received in near real-time or as daily or weekly summaries. Every week approximately 240,000 FIRMS alerts (including daily alerts, Rapid Alerts, and weekly alerts) are sent to users in more than 160 countries, according to the FIRMS team. 7. Improvements in Near Real-Time Data Latency and Reliability The overall LANCE objective is to provide near real-time data and imagery generally within three hours of an instrument observation. NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Operations System ( EDOS ) is the primary provider of all LANCE instrument data directly downloaded from NASA EOS satellites like Terra, Aqua, and Aura. In 2011, EDOS made significant enhancements to the way these data were streamed from ground stations and also improved the way these data were processed and prioritized, which helped reduce the latency for data delivered to LANCE. Today, most LANCE products are available to data users less than three hours after an observation, with some products being available less than two hours after acquisition. 8. First non-EOS mission instrument data added to LANCE in 2015 The addition of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Global Change Observation Mission-Water (GCOM-W1) satellite in March 2015 was the first non-EOS mission data added to LANCE. Currently, six unique AMSR2 data products are available through LANCE. 9. Significant growth in data available through LANCE The addition of AMSR2 near real-time data was followed by the addition of data from several more instruments, including: Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aboard NASA’s Terra satellite; June 2016 Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) aboard Terra; October 2017 VIIRS aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite; first of several data products added February 2016 Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) aboard Suomi NPP; December 2017 VIIRS aboard the joint NASA/NOAA NOAA-20 satellite; August 2019 Along with new instrument data, new data products are constantly being added to the system. Recent additions include: VIIRS Nighttime Imagery product; January 2017 MODIS Global Near Real-Time Flood Product; approved in April 2017 OMPS Pyrocumulonimbus product (PyroCb); October 2018 MODIS Thermal Alert System (MODVOLC); produced in 2019 by LANCE from MODIS data to serve the volcano monitoring community and distributed primarily through the University of Hawaii MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC); produced in 2019 by LANCE to support the air quality and climate/atmospheric modeling communities 10. Addition of first International Space Station mission data in 2018 The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) was installed on the International Space Station in February 2017. LANCE LIS near-real time data are available within two minutes of observation and provide total lightning measurements between +/- 48 degrees latitude, a geographic range that includes nearly all global lightning.

Read more about LANCE and the system architecture . User Community LANCE users span a variety of communities interested in a range of applications. Users come from both the civilian and military sectors, from government and non-government agencies, and from universities and other research intuitions. This section highlights a selection of LANCE users. Fire Global Fire Information Management System (GFIMS)—GFIMS is an operational version of the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) running at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO ), where it complements the FAO’s existing suite of projects charged with delivering near real-time information to ongoing monitoring and emergency projects to other UN organizations as well as providing information to the general public. Global Observation of Forest and Land Cover Dynamics ( GOFC-GOLD )—The GOFC/GOLD-Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme is a project of the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) program and is aimed at refining and articulating the international observation requirements and making the best possible use of fire products from existing and future satellite observing systems for fire management, policy decision-making, and global change research. The UN Global Fire Monitoring Center also provides Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS )-based fire data for the international fire community. Advanced Fire Information System ( AFIS )—AFIS is a comprehensive wildfire information system that provides users with information and intelligence around the prediction, detection, monitoring, and assessment of wildfires globally. Earth observing satellite wildfire detections are complemented with both crowdsource detections from the AFIS Watchtower app as well as through automated in situ camera detection systems capable of detecting thin smoke plumes up to 20 miles away. Fire Danger models such as the Canadian Fire Weather Index ( FWI ) and Australian McArthur Fire Danger models have been fully integrated in to the system and can be produced for any area globally. A new MODIS burned area product has been produced by merging the standard MCD45 MODIS with the MCD64 Burned Area product, while a new Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 algorithm has also been developed to provide higher resolution mapping of new fire events. AFIS provides a hybrid wildfire dashboard providing situational awareness for any region of interest and integrates NASA Worldview into the dashboard to improve the visualization component within the dashboard and provides users with access to not only the Direct Readout station data, but also all NASA Global Imagery Browse Services ( GIBS ) datasets. Floods NRT Global MODIS Flood Mapping —NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Office of Applied Science ( OAS ) is working to operationalize near real-time global flood mapping using NRT MODIS data provided through LANCE. This work builds on the long-time expertise and efforts of the Dartmouth Flood Observatory ( DFO ) to map floodwater extent in detail for active floods. DFO provides additional detail, additional products, and archives of historical flood maps. The maps generated are available to governments and relief organizations. DFO also compiles yearly catalogs, maps, and images of river floods from 1985 to the present, primarily for researchers. Agriculture The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service ( USDA FAS ) uses NRT MODIS imagery from LANCE to observe large areas across the world. These images help FAS improve the accuracy and timeliness of crop yield predictions, which are needed to make decisions affecting U.S. agriculture, trade policy, and food aid. MODIS collects data twice daily: from the Terra satellite in the morning and the Aqua satellite in the afternoon. This helps analysts observe how events such as fires, volcanic eruptions, floods, storms, or extreme temperatures affect crops. Global Agricultural Monitoring ( GLAM ), a collaborative project between the University of Maryland, USDA FAS, and NASA, uses NRT MODIS data to produce crop masks and timely NDVI products that allow FAS analysts to distinguish between different crops like wheat and rice and predict yield by comparing current data with previous years. Air Quality The United States Air Force Weather Agency and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory ( NRL ) rely on MODIS NRT images to monitor and predict dust storms in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. Dust storms can interfere with troop and equipment movement and with aircraft safety. The military also uses NRT imagery for other areas in the world where weather conditions, snow cover, smoke, fires, volcanic eruptions, and other things could impact military operations.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the U.S. NRL monitor for smoke that might be a health threat. Aerosol Robotic Network ( AERONET )—AERONET is a worldwide network of ground based sensors that monitor the air for aerosols to understand the impact of aerosols on climate change. LANCE provides NRT MODIS imagery of the sensor sites. By comparing satellite and ground-based observations, scientists can learn how aerosols reflect and absorb light and can validate satellite-based aerosol observations. This will improve the tools scientists use to monitor aerosols over the entire Earth. Sea Ice The British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) uses MODIS NRT imagery to help navigate sea ice and to populate Polar View , a website that delivers information about sea ice extent and icebergs directly to ships operating in the Southern Ocean. Users of Polar View in the Antarctic include national program operators, tourist vessels, and other ships working in this region. The aim of Polar View is to make sea ice information widely accessible to all ships and operators in the Southern Ocean. The Polar Geospatial Center ( PGC ) uses NRT MODIS imagery to flag significant polar events, this information is used to task higher resolution imagery. PGC also harvests MODIS NRT imagery to add to its collection of satellite imagery supporting researchers and logistics groups in the polar science community. Timely data are used to support the U.S. Antarctic Program ( USAP ). The images are used to plot new courses for the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker, fuel, and cargo ships bringing supplies to McMurdo Station , the American research station on Antarctica. Daily images are crucial to chart a safe course around the drifting icebergs and through the sea ice that covers McMurdo Sound. The images are also being used by scientists who are tracking the movement of icebergs. Outreach As LANCE can create an image of an event such as a major fire the same day it happens, the images are ideal for news and outreach. LANCE provides regular images of storms, fires, and other events as they happen to NASA's Public Affairs Office and the media. MODIS NRT images have been featured in major newspaper and television networks across the world. NASA’s Earth Observatory website posts regular MODIS images of significant events around the world in the Natural Hazards section and in their Image of the Day feature. MODIS NRT images have also appeared on NASA's web portal , Goddard home page, and on Goddard TV . The American Museum of Natural History ( AMNH ) incorporates MODIS NRT images into a regularly updated exhibit about Earth called Science Bulletins . Displayed on interactive kiosks and on high-definition video, the Science Bulletins provide a way for museums to exhibit stories and information about current science, and are intended to show that science is dynamic with new discoveries being made constantly. There are four Science Bulletins: Astro Bulletin , which is about astrophysics and astronomy; Bio Bulletin , about biodiversity and conservation; Earth Bulletin , about Earth and climate; and Human Bulletin , about human interactions with the environment. In addition to being displayed at the American Museum of Natural History, the Bulletins are also made available for display to other science museums, universities, and NASA visitor centers around the U.S. and Canada. Currently, 21 institutions are participating. The Bulletin sites offer additional information not available in the exhibits as well as an archive of past Bulletins. Back to top User Working Group LANCE is reviewed and supported by a User Working Group (UWG) whose members reflect the various user communities served by LANCE. The group is chaired by Miguel Román, Senior Director and Chief Scientist of Climate and Environment at Leidos. Román has taken over from Professor Chris Justice (Chair of the Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland) who was chair for 10 years. The UWG meets at least once per year to review the status of LANCE operations and development activities and to provide guidance concerning future upgrades suggested by the user communities and the LANCE elements. Details of the responsibilities of the UWG are given in the UWG Charter. More information about the User Working Group can be found on the LANCE wiki . Back to top User Working Group (UWG) Charter 1.0 Preface The Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) User Working Group (UWG) shall be responsible for providing guidance and recommendations concerning a broad range of topics related to the LANCE system, capabilities, and services. In these regards, the UWG shall be responsible for representing the broad needs of the LANCE applications user communities. In addition, the UWG members shall have close ties with the various Science Teams for the instruments included in LANCE.

Several factors affect the speed at which data are processed and made available to users. Here's how NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) defines data latency. When a major fire starts in a forest, emergency responders and resource managers need data fast. Data providers use terms such as near real-time and low latency to refer to data provided to users quickly, but what do these terms mean? NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) distributes a wide range of data products to global data users, including satellite observations, imagery, airborne observations, field data, and data published by scientists. Some of these data are available to users within hours. Other data products require extensive processing before they are useful. Data latency is the total time elapsed between when data are acquired by a sensor and when these data are made available to the public. Image Red dots in this image indicate the location of MODIS-detected hotspots on August 20, 2020, from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ), which distributes MODIS and VIIRS near real-time active fire data within three hours of a satellite observation. Credit: NASA FIRMS. NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ) distributes near real-time active fire data within three hours of satellite observation from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and the joint NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. While it is important for emergency responders to have data as quickly as possible, several factors affect the speed at which data are processed and made available to users. Data Latency Terminology NASA and other Earth science data providers use different terminology to describe data latency. The terms near real-time (NRT), low latency, and expedited are often used interchangeably to refer to data that are made available more quickly than routine processing allows. In 2016, a workshop titled “Time Sensitive Applications of NASA Data” was held at NASA's Langley Research Center to identify, coordinate, and focus attention on low-latency satellite data. At this workshop the terms for latency were defined and agreed to by participants across NASA for all data managed by EOSDIS on behalf of NASA’s Earth Science Division. The table below summarizes these terms. Term Latency Purpose Real-time Less than 1 hour These terms are often used to refer to data that are made available quicker than routine processing allows. They are used for a range of applied sciences, decision and tactical support, monitoring and early warning of events. Near real-time (NRT) 1-3 hours Low latency 3-24 hours Expedited 1-4 days Standard routine processing Generally, 8 – 40 hours but up to 2 months for some higher-level products Standard products provide an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earth’s geophysical properties to support science. A new data latency product called ultra real-time (URT) has recently been added to FIRMS. URT MODS and VIIRS thermal anomaly products are available within 60 seconds of acquisition via direct download for display on the FIRMS Fire Map. Note that URT has not been adopted as a formal latency designation by EOSDIS. For more information about URT data in FIRMS, please see FIRMS Adds Ultra Real-Time Data from MODIS and VIIRS and Wildfire Detection in the U.S. and Canada Within a Minute of Satellite Observation . Low-latency data products are made available more quickly than standard processing to support users interested in monitoring a wide variety of natural and man-made phenomena. In the context of NASA data, low latency products are distinct from standard data products in that the algorithms for low latency products are modified to expedite data availability. Image NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS ( LANCE ) supports users interested in monitoring a wide variety of natural and man-made phenomena. Credit: NASA LANCE. One key difference between some NRT and standard products is that NRT data use predictive orbit information for geolocation instead of definitive orbit information, which may not be available until after the NRT products are produced. A second key difference applies to NRT products that make use of ancillary data as part of the processing algorithm from sources other than the satellite. These ancillary data are combined with the satellite data to create higher-level products. Some algorithms for NRT data products use different or less accurate ancillary data than standard products. Standard products are processed using definitive geolocation and instrument calibration, and provide an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of Earth’s geophysical properties to support scientific research. These science-quality standard data products require routine processing, which takes time. They are typically made available between eight hours to two months from data acquisition. If latency is not a primary concern, users are encouraged to use the standard science products. EOSDIS data products are processed at various levels ranging from level 0 to level 4. Level 0 products are raw data at full instrument resolution. At higher levels, the data are converted into more useful parameters and formats. NRT data are often provided at level 0, 1, and 2, and some level 3 products. Level Name Processing Level Level 0 Level 0 data products are reconstructed, unprocessed instrument/payload data at full resolution; any and all communications artifacts, e.g., synchronization frames, communications headers, duplicate data removed. Level 1A Level 1A data products are reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced, and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters, e.g., platform ephemeris, computed and appended but not applied to the Level 0 data. Level 1B Level 1A data that have been processed to sensor units (not all instruments will have a Level 1B equivalent). Level 2 Level 2 data products are derived geophysical variables at the same resolution and location as the Level 1 source data. Level 3 Level 3 data products are variables mapped on uniform space-time grid scales, usually with some completeness and consistency. Level 4 Level 4 data products are model output or results from analyses of lower level data, e.g., variables derived from multiple measurements.

In that context, the land science of VIIRS will build and expand on the heritage of land science from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and EOS MODIS. The strength of these systems lies in their time-series of daily multi-spectral observations, which are used to characterize and monitor the land surface at regional to global scales. MODIS provided a new standard in calibrated, science-quality, coarse-resolution satellite observations that will continue with VIIRS. VIIRS data will be used to expand upon the MODIS applications to fire and air quality monitoring, agriculture monitoring and production modeling, carbon modeling, and flood and sea ice mapping. VIIRS Corrected Reflectance Imagery The VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery is only produced in near real-time. It provides continuity from the MODIS Corrected Reflectance imagery that was developed to provide natural-looking images by removing gross atmospheric effects such as Rayleigh scattering from the visible bands. By contrast, the Surface Reflectance product is available in near real-time and as a standard product. Surface Reflectance provides a more complete atmospheric correction algorithm that includes aerosol correction and is designed to derive land surface properties. In clear atmospheric conditions the corrected reflectance product is similar to the SR product, but they depart from each other in the presence of aerosols. Band Combinations VIIRS (Suomi NPP/NOAA-20) Corrected Reflectance True Color True Color: Red = Band I1 (600-680 nm), Green = Band M4 (545-565 nm), Blue = Band M3 (478-498 nm) These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic, and atmospheric features. The VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as NRT imagery. The imagery can be visualized in NASA's Worldview and Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). The sensor resolution is 750m and 375m (M Bands are 750m, I Bands are 375m), imagery resolution is 250m, temporal resolution is daily, and temporal availability for viewing in GIBS/Worldview is November 24, 2015, to present. View True Color (I1, M4, M3) in Worldview . VIIRS (Suomi NPP/NOAA-20) Corrected Reflectance (Bands M3, I3, M11) False Color: Red = M3 (478-498 nm), Green = I3 (1580-1640 nm), Blue = M11 (2225-2275 nm) This combination is used to map snow and ice. Snow and ice are very reflective in the visible part of the spectrum (Band M3), and very absorbent in Bands I3 and M11 (short-wave infrared, or SWIR). This band combination is good for distinguishing liquid water from frozen water, for example, clouds over snow, ice cloud versus water cloud; or floods from dense vegetation. This layer is similar to the MODIS Corrected Reflectance Bands 3, 6, 7 layer. The VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as NRT imagery. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview and GIBS . The sensor resolution is 750m and 375m (M Bands are 750m, I Bands are 375m), imagery resolution is 250m, temporal resolution is daily, and temporal availability for viewing in GIBS/Worldview is November 24, 2015, to present. View False Color (M3, I3, M11) in Worldview . Snow and Ice Since the only visible light used in these images (Band M3) is assigned to red, snow and ice appear bright red. The more ice, the stronger the absorption in the SWIR bands, and the more red the color. Thick ice and snow appear vivid red (or dark pink), while small ice crystals in high-level clouds will appear pinkish. Vegetation Vegetation will appear green in this band combination, as vegetation is absorbent in Bands M3 and M11, but reflective in Band I3. Bare soil and deserts will appear bright cyan in the image since it is much more reflective in Band I3 and M11 than Band M3. Water Liquid water on the ground will appear very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR, but small liquid water drops in clouds scatter light equally in both the visible and the SWIR, and will therefore appear white. Sediments in water appear dark red. VIIRS (Suomi NPP/NOAA-20) Corrected Reflectance (Bands M11, I2, I1) False Color: Red = M11 (2225-2275 nm), Green = I2 (846-885 nm), Blue = I1 (600-680 nm) This combination is most useful for distinguishing burn scars from naturally low vegetation or bare soil and enhancing floods. This combination can also be used to distinguish snow and ice from clouds. Snow and ice are very reflective in the visible part of the spectrum (Band I1), and absorbent in Bands I2 (near infrared) and M11 (short-wave infrared, or SWIR). Thick ice and snow appear vivid sky blue, while small ice crystals in high-level clouds will also appear blueish, and water clouds will appear white. This layer is similar to the MODIS Corrected Reflectance Bands 7, 2, 1 layer. VIIRS Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as NRT imagery. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview , Worldview Snapshots , and GIBS . The sensor resolution is 750m and 375m (M Bands are 750m, I Bands are 375m), imagery resolution is 250m, temporal resolution is daily, and temporal availability for viewing in GIBS/Worldview is November 24, 2015, to present. View False Color (M11, I2, I1) in Worldview . Vegetation and bare ground Vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared (Band I2), and absorbent in Band I1 and Band M11. Assigning that band to green means even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Naturally bare soil, like a desert, is reflective in all bands used in this image, but more so in the SWIR (Band M11, red) and so soils will often have a pinkish tinge. Burned areas Burned areas or fire-affected areas are characterized by deposits of charcoal and ash, removal of vegetation, and the alteration of vegetation structure. When bare soil becomes exposed, the brightness in Band I1 may increase, but that may be offset by the presence of black carbon residue; the near infrared (Band I2) will become darker, and Band M11 becomes more reflective. When assigned to red in the image, Band M11 will show burn scars as deep or bright red, depending on the type of vegetation burned, the amount of residue, or the completeness of the burn. Water Liquid water on the ground appears very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR. Sediments in water appear dark blue. Ice and snow appear as bright turquoise. Clouds comprised of small water droplets scatter light equally in both the visible and the SWIR and will appear white. These clouds are usually lower to the ground and warmer. High and cold clouds are comprised of ice crystals and will appear turquoise.

This timely data is useful for a range of applications e.g. to detect fires, track smoke, ash and dust plumes; to monitor aerosols, carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), which in turn are useful for air quality assessments; and to determine the extent of sea ice, snow, and flooding which are useful to support shipping in the polar regions and to allow rapid assessment of areas worst affected by snow or flood water. Visualize the data by category in Worldview . Register for an Earthdata Login to start downloading data. Please read the LANCE disclaimer for more information about using the data. Air Quality Satellite data have been used to track propagation of toxic gases like CO from massive fires; accurate early warnings of such pollution spikes are useful because they give people the option to reduce their risk of exposure to poor air by limiting outdoor activity at these times. Ash Plumes Satellite data are useful for identifying and tracking ash plumes from volcanic eruptions. The use of NRT satellite data for monitoring volcanic plumes is undergoing further developments to enable quantitative retrievals to be produced, which should enable a global capability for volcanic ash monitoring to be introduced. Drought Agro-climatic monitoring programs and global food security risks are monitored using NRT satellite data including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and GEOGLAM. Dust Storms Dust storms can have an impact on human health, weather patterns as well as cause disruption through flight delays and the closure of highways. Data from LANCE are used to monitor and predict dust storms. This information is used by agencies within the Department of Defense to improve resource allocation in remote areas and help promote aircraft safety. Fires Ultra Real-Time (URT), Real-Time (RT), NRT satellite data and imagery enable people on the ground, including those responsible for mobilizing fire-fighting resources around the world, detailed information about the locations of fires. URT, RT and NRT MODIS, VIIRS and Landsat active fire/hotspot data are available in easy to use formats through the Fire Information for Resource Management System ( FIRMS ). Floods Mapping floodwater extent for active floods is critical for local and regional officials and for disaster relief organizations that need to ascertain where to focus their efforts. Severe Storms MODIS data are used to revise or confirm 24-hour forecasts related to weather systems approaching the land from the oceans, which in turn gives confidence for flood warnings. Satellite images are also useful in providing everyone with the same 'big picture' of severe storms. Shipping In the polar regions, NRT satellite imagery provided by LANCE are routinely, in combination with other data, are used to provide up-to-date information on sea ice conditions to ships and research vessels. Smoke Plumes True color imagery and satellite-derived aerosol and carbon monoxide products are frequently used to track the source, duration and transport of smoke plumes across large areas. Smoke from large wildfires to be lofted high enough into the atmosphere that winds push plumes long distances; a process that can often be tracked in near-real time using data from LANCE. Vegetation Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images produced from LANCE data are used to monitor vegetation and crop condition. Groups such as the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Desert Locust Information Service flag anomalies in vegetation.

Hence, most C61 land NRT products are largely identical to C6 equivalents, barring small changes introduced by the changes in L1B. The only other notable change in C61 has been a correction to flagging of some high-aerosol areas, in the L2 Land Surface-Reflectance (LSR) that is mostly seen over brighter desert areas. For further details on the C61 L1B changes and minor updates to other land products, users are requested to refer to this C61 Land change document . Additional details regarding the revision to the C61 L2 LSR high-aerosol flagging can be found here . Users are requested to make a note of this proposed change in LANCE NRT MODIS products. For performance comparison of the C61 NRT and STD products, users can still refer to the C6 performance metrics that can be found here . If you have any further concern or question about this transition, please contact the LANCE MODIS User Support ; for questions or information related to change in product quality contact the land QA team . NRT4 URL for C6.1 products is: https://nrt4.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/61/ The C6 L1 and atmosphere products will continue in parallel with the C6.1 collection processing and be made available at https://nrt3.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/6/ until April 1, 2021, at which time, only C6.1 NRT products will be available. To review updates to C6.1 L1 and Atmosphere products, please visit the MODIS Atmosphere Team page . MODIS Corrected Reflectance Imagery The MODIS Corrected Reflectance imagery is only produced in near real-time. It was developed to provide natural-looking images by removing gross atmospheric effects such as Rayleigh scattering from the visible bands. By contrast, the Surface Reflectance (SR) product is available in near real-time and as a standard product. Surface Reflectance provides a more complete atmospheric correction algorithm that includes aerosol correction and is designed to derive land surface properties. In clear atmospheric conditions the corrected reflectance product is similar to the SR product, but they depart from each other in the presence of aerosols. Band Combinations MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Corrected Reflectance (True Color) True Color: Red = Band 1 (670 nm), Green = Band 4 (565 nm), Blue = Band 3 (479 nm) These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic, and atmospheric features. The downside of this set of bands is that they tend to produce a hazy image. This layer is similar to the VIIRS Corrected Reflectance Bands I1, M4, M3 layer. MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Corrected Reflectance (Bands 7, 2, 1) False Color: Red = Band 7 (2155 nm), Green = Band 2 (876 nm), Blue = Band 1 (670 nm) This combination is most useful for distinguishing burn scars from naturally low vegetation or bare soil and enhancing floods. This combination can also be used to distinguish snow and ice from clouds. Snow and ice are very reflective in the visible part of the spectrum (Band 1), and absorbent in Bands 2 (near infrared) and 7 (short-wave infrared, or SWIR). Thick ice and snow appear vivid sky blue, while small ice crystals in high-level clouds will also appear blueish, and water clouds will appear white. This layer is similar to the VIIRS Corrected Reflectance Bands M11, I2, I1 layer. The MODIS Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as near real-time imagery. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview and the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). The sensor resolution is 500 m and 250 m (Bands 1 and 2 have a sensor resolution of 250 m, Bands 3 - 7 have a sensor resolution of 500 m, and Bands 8 - 36 are 1 km. Band 1 is used to sharpen Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7), imagery resolution is 250 m, and the temporal resolution is daily. Applications of MODIS Corrected Reflectance (Bands 7, 2, 1) Colors Vegetation: Green Water: Black or dark blue Desert/naturally bare soil: Sandy pink Burn scar: Red to reddish-brown, depending on the nature of the pre-fire vegetation and the severity of the burn. Vegetation and bare ground Vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared (Band 2), and absorbent in Band 1 and Band 7. Assigning that band to green means even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Naturally bare soil, like a desert, is reflective in all bands used in this image, but more so in the SWIR (Band 7, red) and so soils will often have a pinkish tinge. Burned areas Burned areas or fire-affected areas are characterized by deposits of charcoal and ash, removal of vegetation and/or the alteration of vegetation structure. When bare soil becomes exposed, the brightness in Band 1 may increase, but that may be offset by the presence of black carbon residue; the near infrared (Band 2) will become darker, and Band 7 becomes more reflective. When assigned to red in the image, Band 7 will show burn scars as deep or bright red, depending on the type of vegetation burned, the amount of residue, or the completeness of the burn. Water Liquid water on the ground appears very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR. Sediments in water appear dark blue. Ice and snow appear as bright turquoise. Clouds comprised of small water droplets scatter light equally in both the visible and the SWIR and will appear white. These clouds are usually lower to the ground and warmer. High and cold clouds are comprised of ice crystals and will appear turquoise. MODIS (Terra) Corrected Reflectance (Bands 3, 6, 7) False Color: Red = Band 3 (479 nm), Green = Band 6 (1652 nm), Blue = Band 7 (2155 nm) This combination is used to map snow and ice. Snow and ice are very reflective in the visible part of the spectrum (Band 3), and very absorbent in Bands 6 and 7 (short-wave infrared, or SWIR). This band combination is good for distinguishing liquid water from frozen water, for example, clouds over snow, ice cloud versus water cloud; or floods from dense vegetation. This band combination is only available for MODIS (Terra) because 70% of the band 6 sensors on the MODIS instrument aboard the Aqua satellite failed shortly after launch. This layer is similar to the VIIRS Corrected Reflectance Bands M3, I3, M11 layer. Applications of MODIS Corrected Reflectance (Bands 3, 6, 7) Colors Vegetation: Green Ice or snow: Red Liquid water on the ground: Black or dark red Liquid water clouds: White Ice clouds: Peach Desert: Light blue-green Snow and Ice Since the only visible light used in these images (Band 3) is assigned to red, snow and ice appear bright red. The more ice, the stronger the absorption in the SWIR bands, and the more red the color. Thick ice and snow appear vivid red (or red-orange), while small ice crystals in high-level clouds will appear reddish-orange or peach. Vegetation Vegetation will appear green in this band combination, as vegetation is absorbent in Bands 3 and 7, but reflective in Band 6. Bare soil and deserts will appear bright cyan in the image since it much more reflective in Band 6 and 7 than Band 3. Water Liquid water on the ground will appear very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR, but small liquid water drops in clouds scatter light equally in both the visible and the SWIR, and will therefore appear white. Sediments in water appear dark red. MODIS Surface Reflectance The MODIS Surface Reflectance products provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance as it would be measured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or absorption. Compared to Corrected Reflectance imagery, the MODIS Land Surface Reflectance product (MOD09) is a more complete atmospheric correction algorithm that includes aerosol correction, and is designed to derive land surface properties. In clear atmospheric conditions the Corrected Reflectance product is very similar to the MOD09 product, but they depart from each other in presence of aerosols. Layers visible in GIBS and Worldview include: MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Land Surface Reflectance (True Color) True Color: Red = Band 1 (670 nm), Green = Band 4 (565 nm), Blue = Band 3 (479 nm) These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic, and atmospheric features. MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Land Surface Reflectance (Bands 7, 2, 1) False Color: Red = Band 7 (2155 nm), Green = Band 2 (876 nm), Blue = Band 1 (670 nm) This combination is most useful for distinguishing burn scars from naturally low vegetation or bare soil and enhancing floods. Vegetation will appear green and burned areas will appear reddish. MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Land Surface Reflectance (Bands 1, 2, 1) False Color: Red= Band 1 (670 nm), Green = Band 2 (876 nm), Blue = Band 1 (670 nm) Vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared (Band 2), and absorbent in Band 1. Assigning Band 2 to green means even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Liquid water on the ground will be very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR and sediments in water appear pink. This band combination is good for identifying vegetation changes, drought, and floods. This layer is only available as a Surface Reflectance layer; there is no corrected reflectance version of this layer.

(The team had previously considered discontinuing the nitrous oxide and nitric acid products, but they remain in this dataset release.) The networks were trained on 75% of the valid v5 MLS standard temperature product retrievals between January 2005 and August 2022 and their associated, nearest radiance profiles. The ANN processed results were validated using the remaining 25% of profiles. As the MLS v5.0 standard products are used as \"truth\" in the training, the best-case output of the ANN is a computationally-inexpensive, high-fidelity preview of the v5.0 standard-production profiles.

Note: To see an animation of these data, visit the AIRS website . In January 2022, NASA announced that, due to a limited remaining fuel supply, the Aqua satellite—the second flagship satellite of the agency’s Earth Observing System (EOS )—lowered its orbit to leave the A-Train . The A-Train is an international constellation of satellites that follow one another along the same orbital track and cross the equator at about 1:30 p.m., Mean Local Time (MLT). This means Aqua left its tightly controlled orbit and entered a free-drift mode in which its equatorial crossing time slowly gets later and later into the afternoon. By February 2023, the satellite was expected to reach, and possibly exceed, an equatorial crossing time of 1:45 p.m., MLT. As it drifts, the instruments aboard Aqua will continue to transmit valuable data until losses of power and fuel bring an end to the mission. NASA officials estimate termination will occur in mid-to-late 2026, and when it happens those who rely on data from Aqua’s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS ) instrument will have to begin using data from its instrument follow-ons: the Cross-track Infrared Sounder ( CrIS ) and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder ( ATMS ) aboard NASA/NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System ( JPSS ) satellites, the successors of the EOS missions. Launched on May 4, 2002, along with the other instruments aboard Aqua, AIRS was designed to improve weather forecasting by providing more frequent and detailed information about the atmosphere. AIRS probes a column of air 90 times every 2.67 seconds, or about 2.9 million times a day, from the top of the atmosphere to Earth’s surface, collecting measurements of humidity, temperature, cloud properties, and greenhouse gases with its 2,378 infrared spectral channels and 4 visible/near-infrared channels. This wide array of channels, each associated with particular atmospheric properties or combinations of properties, and with particular heights or levels in the atmosphere, produced data that meteorologists could use to greatly improve the accuracy and vertical resolution of atmospheric profiles. The result of these improved soundings has been more reliable climate prediction and improved weather forecasts. “AIRS revolutionized weather prediction by providing, for the first time, a three-dimensional picture of the atmosphere,” said Dr. Joao Teixeira, AIRS Science Team Leader, in an article commemorating Aqua’s 20th year in orbit . “Now there are a few infrared sounders in orbit, but AIRS still is one of the key sensors and, for the first few years, it was the only one.” The more than two decades AIRS has been in orbit is remarkable, both in terms of its stability and for the contributions its 20-plus years of atmospheric data have made to the remote sensing and Earth science communities.

It’s one of the few instruments out there that just gives so much information and does it at the exact same observing time every day.” Part of what made AIRS so significant for the weather community is its ability to provide high-resolution observations of both temperature and water vapor. “Temperature is a very fundamental variable in atmospheric physics and for climate,” said Teixeira. “Water vapor also plays a very large role, partly because it is responsible for clouds, which are condensed water vapor in the atmosphere, and water vapor essentially controls how many clouds there are and how much precipitation there is. Water vapor also interacts with the radiation emitted by the planet, and that’s why we can detect it with this instrument. It also plays a role in how much the atmosphere is mixing vertically and the processes that promote it.” AIRS, an infrared instrument, cannot “see” through clouds, so it was designed to work in conjunction with the microwave sensors aboard Aqua—the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit ( AMSU ) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil ( HSB ). AMSU is particularly useful for obtaining temperature profiles in the atmosphere. HSB was designed to measure the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, but it suffered a catastrophic failure in early 2003. Since then, AIRS and AMSU have continued to provide atmospheric temperature and water vapor measurements that are much more accurate than previous space-based measurements. CrIS, the first of the JPSS follow-on instruments, is an advanced spectrometer with 1,305 infrared spectral channels designed to provide high vertical resolution information on the atmosphere's three-dimensional structure of temperature and water vapor. ATMS observes Earth in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which allows it to see through clouds to provide information about the physical properties of our atmosphere, such as temperature and moisture, which heavily influence weather patterns. CrIS and ATMS are designed to work in concert to produce global high-resolution and three-dimensional atmospheric temperature, pressure, and moisture profiles from space.

Credit: NASA. Pairs of the instruments are carried on the first three JPSS satellites currently in space: the joint NASA-NOAA Suomi Polar-orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ), NOAA-20 , and the recently launched JPSS-2 . Suomi NPP launched in 2011 and NOAA-20 launched in 2017, so the CrIS and ATMS instruments they carry have been operational for years. Functionally, CrIS and ATMS are quite comparable to AIRS, AMSU, and HSB. “It’s kind of like what’s better, a Toyota or a Chevrolet? They’re both cars and they both get you where you need to go,” said Dr. Eric Fetzer, Project Scientist for the AIRS project at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ). “There are a lot of details that are different, we can have long discussions about how the spectrometric instrumentation is fundamentally different—AIRS is a grating spectrometer, CrIS is an interferometer, so the measurements are obtained in a different way, but you basically have the same information and they’re not radically different.” Teixeira agrees. “For the majority of the products that we produce right now, from the purest scientific ones to the more applied ones, I don’t think the users will necessarily see an enormous difference, provided NASA continues to support this work,” he said. “So, if people use temperature or water vapor profiles or if they use ground surface temperature from AIRS to study drought, they will be able to continue to do so with CrIS. These products will continue to exist.” According to Lena Iredell, the reason there isn’t much difference among the products is that the same scientists are involved in generating data products for both the infrared and microwave instruments. Dr. Bjorn Lambrigtsen at JPL is doing all of the microwave instrumentation for AIRS and ATMS, and Dr. Hank Revercomb at The University of Wisconsin and Dr. Larrabee Strow of the University of Maryland Baltimore County are doing all of the infrared instrumentation for AIRS and CrIS. As Iredell notes, this makes the Level 1B and C products “very consistent.\" Further, work by Strow and his colleagues has resulted in new products designed to facilitate the transition from AIRS to CrIS.

Dark blue colors in the image represent liquid water and ice clouds. Yellows indicate that the radiation is from the warm Earth's surface or a dry layer in the middle troposphere. Credit: STAR CrIS SDR Team. “Beyond the Level 1B algorithm, Strow also has what he calls a Level 1C algorithm, which smooths things out and fills things in,” Iredell said. “He has gone even further and made what he calls a Level 1D product, which does a similar thing across all the instrumentation—from AIRS to CrIS and [from] CrIS to CrIS—so that people can use these data as inputs to their forecast models or for reanalysis.” There is similar continuity among the more processed data products, said Teixeira. “What matters to most people are what we call the Level 2 and Level 3 data products, products like the temperature profiles, water vapor, carbon dioxide, clouds, methane, aerosols, and so on,” he said. “What the community has been trying to do, be it through [NASA] Headquarters projects, the AIRS project, or other smaller entities, is develop algorithms that are unified in the sense that they can extract information both from the AIRS and CrIS radiances to create similar products from both instruments.” One of those algorithms—the Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Atmosphere Product System ( CLIMCAPS ) algorithm—produces products from both AIRS and CrIS radiances in a way that is similar to the AIRS algorithm developed by the AIRS science team. “With CLIMCAPS you use the same piece of code with very small changes between the two,” Teixeira said. “This is the type of effort being funded by NASA, and a lot of this has been done with the help of the AIRS project.” It is possible that those “small changes” could impact data users, depending on their geographical areas of interest and the research they conduct. “There are some subtle differences in the algorithms that have to do with how they compute the initial guess. So, if someone focused on a particular area or feature, such as ice and snow over Greenland and the Poles or desert regions, there might be subtle differences between the AIRS science team algorithm and the CLIMCAPS algorithm,” said Iredell. “But in the majority of cases, the differences are very minor; the algorithms are very consistent among each other. Switching from the one to the other, and especially if they use the AIRS data from the CLIMCAPS system throughout, it’s very consistent across satellites and across the algorithms.” To address such challenges, Fetzer suggests that users take the time to familiarize themselves with the products based on these new algorithms. At the same time, he noted that the sounder community will need to “show as much consistency between the new products and the old” as it possibly can. “Having different instruments on different spacecraft [means] you’re looking at a slightly different atmosphere and there are issues [associated with] the instruments being at different orbital heights, even though they’re in the same base local time, or they were until Aqua started to drift,” Fetzer said. “So, they’re not looking at exactly the same thing at exactly the same time. That needs to be well understood if we’re trying to put together a long-term data record of retrieved quantities.” That reconciliation is happening, said Teixeira, but it takes time. “The algorithms that we have to develop for instruments like AIRS or CrIS are extremely complicated, so it has likely taken longer for the CrIS algorithms to come to fruition. AIRS has 2,378 infrared channels and 4 visible/near-infrared channels, so there’s a lot of information in those and extracting the right information is an enormous challenge,” he said. “We have unified algorithms that extract radiances from both AIRS and CrIS to produce all these different geophysical products that look fairly similar. The radiances come from different instruments, but if you look at the climatologies, they don’t really look much different. This is a reassurance that, indeed, these products are doing what they’re supposed to do.” And the expectation is that the next-generation instruments aboard the JPSS spacecraft will continue providing this service until the 2040s. Image Data users can get answers to their questions by contacting the AIRS project via the “Ask AIRS” box of the AIRS project website. Users can also direct their questions to NASA’s GES DISC via the “contact us” page on the DAAC’s website. “In a sense we’re blessed,” said Fetzer. “I look at other instruments on EOS and most of them don’t have the same degree of continuity. But for us, you turn around and there’s a new hyperspectral infrared sounder being launched and others are being proposed. So, from the climate perspective, I think the view is, I have really good measurements starting in 2002 with AIRS and continuing into the 2030s and even the 2040s with follow-on instruments.” Nevertheless, Fetzer acknowledges that putting together a consistent picture of the atmosphere from these many different sounding instruments in different orbits from different spacecraft presents a unique challenge. “In a sense, there’s almost too much here,” he said. “It’s like having too much money. What would you do if someone gave you a billion dollars? There is some good to be done with it, but the challenge is really making sense of all these different datasets in a consistent way.” Data users can help address that challenge, said Fetzer, by sharing their research-oriented questions. “Hypothetically, what if someone wants to look at some quantity observed by AIRS starting in 2002 and they want to look at that same quantity with CrIS instruments until 2032? There’s a good chance they’ll be able to do that,” he said. “Similarly, what happens when you transition from AIRS to one CrIS to another? What happens when you transition from one CrIS instrument to another? New and better is good, but slightly different throws you a curve ball.” Users looking for answers to these and other data continuity questions should direct their queries to NASA's GES DISC via the contact us link on the DAAC’s website or to the AIRS project via the Ask AIRS dialog box on the AIRS website. “If people need to know something, they can pose their questions directly to the AIRS project and we’ll answer,” Teixeira said. “That is probably the best place to start.” Teixeira is quick to add, however, that the AIRS project isn’t going away tomorrow. “The hope is that we will have AIRS data for the next three years, and the expectation from the Aqua mission is that we will have enough power to exist until the end of 2026,” he said. “Whether we’ll have enough funding to continue the AIRS project is something that has yet to be decided, but I’m hopeful that’s the case.” Topics Atmosphere Atmospheric Temperature | Atmospheric Water Vapor | Cloud Properties | Clouds | Humidity | Water Vapor Indicators | Weather Events | Weather/Climate Advisories Human Dimensions Environmental Impacts | Industrial Emissions Data Archives GES DISC Sensors AIRS ATMS CrIS Featured Discover Open Science Resources Last Updated Feb 23, 2023 Discover More From Earthdata Subscribe You might also be interested in Program ESDIS Weekly Metrics: March 23, 2023 Data User Profile User Profile: Dr. Owen Cooper Program ESDIS Weekly Metrics: March 16, 2023 Program ESDIS Monthly Metrics: September 2021"]},

Jun 24, 2021 Dr. Kyla Drushka, Principal Oceanographer at the Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington Image Dr. Kyla Drushka deploys ocean drifters to measure ocean currents at the sea surface. Drushka and her colleagues used these and other devices during a 2018 campaign she co-led off of the California coast near Monterrey/San Francisco. Credit: Peter Gaube. Research Interests: Understanding the dynamics of the upper ocean and, in particular, the effect that variations in ocean salinity (the concentration of dissolved salts in seawater) may have on and near the ocean surface. In rainy tropical regions and the Arctic, salinity sets the structure and stability of the “mixed layer” – the well-mixed part of the upper ocean that comes into contact with the atmosphere. As a result, changes in salinity caused by precipitation, evaporation, ice melt and freezing, river runoff, or ocean currents can have large impacts on the amount of heat, momentum, and gas exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere. This, in turn, can have a significant effect on weather and climate. Research Highlights: Everyone knows seawater is salty, but far fewer know how it got that way and what roles saltiness, or in the vernacular of oceanography, salinity , plays in ocean structure and dynamics. Salinity refers to the concentration of salt in seawater and several natural processes, including the weathering of rocks, the evaporation of ocean water, and the formation of sea ice, contribute to it. At the same time, these salinity-increasing processes are balanced by salinity-decreasing actions, such as the flow of fresh water into the ocean, precipitation in the form of rain or snow, and melting ice. Scientists have learned that even small variations in ocean surface salinity can have dramatic effects on ocean circulation and structure, particularly near the surface. Ocean circulation is primarily driven by changes in seawater density , and density is determined by salinity and temperature. Given that the top three meters of the ocean stores more heat than the entire atmosphere, density-controlled ocean circulation (that is, when the dense ocean water sinks and joins deep ocean currents) plays a key role in transporting heat around the world and maintaining Earth's climate. Scientists know the ocean absorbs and transports the excess heat associated with the rise in global temperatures that has occurred during the last century. Further, studies suggest that ocean salinity is decreasing at high latitudes and in tropical areas that experience frequent rain, and increasing in the seawater of Earth’s sub-tropical, high-evaporation regions. Such changes in the water cycle could significantly impact not only ocean circulation, but also the climate in which we live. For example, ocean currents act much like a conveyor belt , transporting warm water and precipitation from the equator toward the poles and cold water from the poles back to the tropics. In doing so, ocean currents regulate global climate, helping to counteract the uneven distribution of solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface. Without currents in the ocean, regional temperatures would be more extreme—super hot at the equator and frigid toward the poles—and much less of Earth’s land would be habitable.

Credit: Benjamin Greenwood. Among the scientists working to understand the impact of variability in ocean salinity is Dr. Kyla Drushka, Principal Oceanographer at the Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington. “NASA has been measuring salinity from satellites since 2011, giving us an amazing new tool to monitor ocean variability,” said Drushka. “As a member of NASA’s Ocean Salinity Science Team since 2014, I have been focusing on quantifying and understanding how rainfall affects upper ocean salinity, stability, and air-sea exchanges as well as how we can use this information to improve the validation of salinity measurements such as those from the Aquarius and Soil Moisture Active Passive ( SMAP ) satellite missions.” Drushka is currently involved in several projects that aim to enhance the oceanography community’s understanding of the effect of rainfall on salinity in the upper ocean—work that is motivated, in part, by the knowledge that the global hydrological cycle is speeding up due to climate change. Drushka notes, however, that it is hard to measure where and how fast those water cycle changes are happening. “One idea is that if we knew the relationship between rainfall and ocean salinity, we could use satellite salinity measurements to measure and monitor the water cycle,” she said. Drushka and her colleagues tested this idea in 2016 and 2017 during the SPURS-2 experiments. The Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study, or SPURS , is a two-part series of science process studies and oceanographic field experiments designed to uncover the mechanisms responsible for near-surface salinity variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean. In particular, SPURS seeks to quantify the relative significance of circulation, evaporation, precipitation over a range of scales in representative areas of the open ocean to explain the ocean’s role in global water cycle budgets and its relationship to climate. Funded principally by NASA with support from other US agencies and European partners, the project involves two field campaigns (SPURS-1 and -2) and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that exhibit salinity and precipitation extremes. The SPURS initiative also incorporates a suite of in-situ sampling technologies that, when combined with satellite-derived measurements of salinity, provide a detailed characterization of the ocean’s salinity structure over a variety of spatiotemporal scales. Among the technologies that Drushka and her team used during the SPURS-2 experiments was the Surface Salinity Profiler (SSP), which Drushka describes as “a surfboard outfitted with sensors to measure salinity, temperature, and turbulence.” This instrument was towed in the waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean outside of the ship’s wake, allowing it to take surface salinity measurements in water that hadn’t been disturbed by the ship. Image Kyla Drushka connects with the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) before deploying it over the side of the research vessel OCEARCH. The ADCP, the white device connected to the blue tow-body shown in this photo, collects ocean current (velocity) data as it is towed from the side of the ship. Credit: Mike Coots, OCEARCH. “The [SSP] data analyzed by University of Washington graduate student Suneil Iyer showed the horizontal and vertical patterns of salinity near the surface, enabling us to develop relationships between salinity, turbulence, rain, and wind,” she said. “I’m currently involved in follow-on projects with my colleagues March Jacob, Elizabeth Thompson, and Haonan Chen to develop simple ways to predict salinity anomalies based on satellite measurements of rain and wind and to understand how the spatial patterns of rainfall imprint on the spatial patterns of salinity. In addition, Drushka is also developing a new project, Salinity and Stratification at the Sea Ice Edge ( SASSIE ), that will explore some of the same ocean attributes and mechanisms investigated during the SPURS-2 study, but in the Arctic Ocean. “In 2022, we will take a ship, airplane, and many autonomous and drifting instruments, including a new jet-powered version of the SSP that is piloted remotely instead of towed, to the Beaufort Sea to measure the near-surface fresh salinity anomalies produced by melting sea ice during the summer,” she said. “Much like with rainfall, these fresh layers on the surface increase the stability and reduce the mixing in the upper ocean. Because the water ~10 meters deep is relatively warm in the Arctic, a reduction in mixing means that this heat stays trapped at this depth and so the ocean surface can cool down faster when the weather gets cold. We hypothesize that regions with fresh, stable melt-water layers at the end of summer will see rapid ice formation in early autumn due to this increased stability and reduction in mixing.” To conduct their research, Drushka and her colleagues rely on datasets from a variety of sources, including NASA's Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center ( PO.DAAC ) located at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. PO.DAAC manages, archives, and distributes the data, tools, and resources in NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System ( EOSDIS ) collection pertaining to the physical processes and condition of the global ocean, such as ocean winds, sea surface temperature, ocean surface topography, sea surface salinity, and circulation. Image Among the PO.DAAC datasets that Drushka and her colleagues use in their research are sea surface salinity and wind speed data from the joint U.S./Argentinian Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas (SAC)-D (or Aquarius/SAC-D ) mission; mapped sea surface salinity data from NASA’s SMAP satellite mission; 5-day mean ocean surface wind data from the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) project ; and salinity, temperature, turbulence, and water column profile observations derived from the SSP and other instruments used during the SPURS-2 campaign. For example, in a 2016 study conducted to improve understanding of the formation and evolution of rain-formed lenses (aka: layers of buoyant fresh water) at the ocean surface, Drushka and her colleagues compared sea surface salinity measurements from the Aquarius/SAC-D mission and other platforms with outputs from the Generalized Ocean Turbulence Model ( GOTM ), a 1-dimensional ocean model used to simulate the impacts of individual rain events on the upper ocean salinity. Prior to this work, it was well known that rain generated fresh lenses at the surface, but neither their characteristics, such as thickness, stratification strength, and longevity, nor their impact on satellite salinity observations had been investigated. After performing several experiments with the GOTM model to explore how meteorological events with different rain rates and wind speeds affect the depth, strength, and duration of rain layers, Drushka and her team found that the GOTM could reproduce the main characteristics of rain-formed fresh lenses. Their research also demonstrated how the presence of rain-formed lenses may account for the “fresh bias,” of satellites wherein satellite-derived measurements of salinity tend to be slightly less saline than in situ measurements in rainy, low-wind regions. Drushka and her colleagues built on these findings in a 2019 study on the relationship among rain, wind, and salinity. During the SPURS-2 field experiments in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean in 2016 and 2017, she and her team members used the SSP to measure temperature and salinity profiles in the upper 1.1 m of the ocean. Data from the SSP captured the ocean surface’s response to 35 rain events, providing insight into the generation and evolution of rain-formed fresh layers. For the 35 rain events sampled, the maximum vertical salinity gradient in the upper meter of the ocean ranged from less than 0.01 to over 3 grams per kilogram, which was found to be well correlated with the amount of accumulated rainfall, linearly proportional to the maximum rain rate, and inversely proportional to wind speed. These findings suggest that the vertical salinity gradient formed during any rain event depends on a complex interaction between local ocean dynamics and the highly variable forcing from rain and wind. “While the modeling results were pretty straightforward, the in-situ measurements [from the SSP] underscore how complex the upper ocean response to rainfall is,” Drushka said. “Nonetheless, the results from this work are an important step in helping predict salinity anomalies from space-based measurements.” Image This data visualization shows the first full year of validated ocean surface salinity from NASA's Aquarius instrument, averaged from December 2011 through December 2012. Red colors represent areas of high salinity, while blue shades represent areas of low salinity. Aquarius has provided a global view of salinity variability needed for climate studies. Credit: NASA/GSFC/JPL-Caltech. In another 2019 paper, Drushka conducted a detailed study of the patterns of sub-mesoscale (i.e., at a scale of 1 to 10 kilometers) temperature and salinity fronts by combining a number of existing databases, which include data from hundreds of ships, to get nearly global coverage of surface salinity and temperature measurements. In doing so, she revealed spatial patterns of surface salinity variability that were previously unknown. Her findings helped to explain why the surface salinity measurements from satellites may differ from those of Argo floats (i.e., satellite errors in highly variable regions in fact arise because Argo measurements made at single location do not represent spatially averaged satellite data.) “In regions with river plumes, ice melt, and strong currents like the Gulf Stream, surface salinity variability is strong and can have a much larger impact on density and ocean dynamics than temperature does,” she said. “This work also helped show where salinity variability that is smaller than the pixel of a satellite measurement may contribute to satellite errors.” Small-scale ocean variability is important, as emerging evidence suggests that oceanic structures at scales smaller than 100 km have an important contribution to ocean circulation, air-sea interactions, and biogeochemical cycling. However, satellites that measure sea surface salinity are known to have a resolution lower than 40 kilometers and do not allow the observation of small-scale structures. In the interest of developing techniques for obtaining satellite salinity measurements at the highest possible spatial resolution, Bárbara Barceló-Llull, a postdoctoral researcher working with Drushka, conducted a study to investigate small-scale variability (≲25 km) by reconstructing gridded sea surface salinity observations from the SMAP satellite in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. When compared to in-situ salinity observations made by a ship-board thermosalinograph (i.e., a device used to measure sea surface temperature and salinity), reconstructed SMAP observations revealed a significant improvement in small-scale salinity variability as compared to the original SMAP measurements, particularly from the continental shelf to the Gulf Stream. In the Sargasso Sea, however, both the original and reconstructed SMAP observations contained higher variability than the in-situ observations. Observational differences aside, small-scale salinity variability was found to be concentrated in two bands: a northern band aligned with the continental shelf break, and a southern band aligned with the Gulf Stream mean position. In addition, seasonal differences in the small-scale salinity variability were mainly driven by the seasonal cycle of the large-scale sea surface salinity induced by the freshening of the coastal waters from river outflow. These results pertaining to small-scale salinity variability, in conjunction with those of Drushka’s other research, reveal the value of NASA satellite-derived sea surface salinity observations for her research. They also explain why Drushka is so focused on using her growing knowledge of rainfall’s affects upper ocean salinity and stability to enhance the accuracy of satellite salinity measurements, making them even better.

Image from Catherine Bouchard, Public Health Agency of Canada. In the summer of 2014, I spent a day in Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C. I was hiking off-trail, venturing into the woods, and, most importantly, not wearing bug spray. A few days later I felt tired and achy. I thought I had a bad cold or the flu. Later, while I was swimming in a pool, my boyfriend pointed at my back with a terrified look on his face. “You have a big bull's-eye rash on your left shoulder blade,” he said. Sure enough, the glaring bull's-eye rash on my back told me I had probably been bitten by a tick carrying bacteria known as Borrelia burgdorferi , which causes Lyme disease. I had only recently moved to D.C. and hadn't realized that I needed to check for ticks. The doctor confirmed that it was Lyme disease and I took a hefty course of antibiotics to clear it from my system. Lyme disease is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in North America. In 2014, my case was one of more than 25,350 reported in the U.S., according to the CDC . Deer ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ), which carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, are found in warm, forested areas in the Northern Hemisphere. And as the global climate warms, deer ticks are migrating north, which means more people are at risk of contracting the disease. Dr. Serge Olivier Kotchi, who works at the Public Health Agency of Canada, studies Lyme disease as a medical geographer, which means he studies health and disease from a geographic perspective. Specifically, Kotchi has been studying how climate change impacts the incidence of vector-borne diseases in Canada, such as Lyme and West Nile Virus. Kotchi and his colleagues recently published a study in Remote Sensing which found that the risk of Lyme disease in Canada is expanding north as temperatures change. They found that between 2000 and 2015, Lyme risk doubled in the province of Quebec in eastern Canada and tripled in the province of Manitoba in central Canada. Image The authors mapped established populations of deer ticks by using field data of tick surveillance from previous research in combination with remote sensing data and temperature data from meteorological stations. Previous field research in Canada used a technique called drag sampling to determine the presence of deer ticks. Researchers drag a square meter piece of cloth through the woods and count the number of ticks that fall on the cloth. This sampling technique also involves capturing rodents in live traps and examining them for ticks and Lyme exposure. In order to map Lyme risk over a large area at a 1 kilometer resolution, Kotchi and his colleagues combined these field data with remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. He used MODIS land surface temperature ( MOD11A2 ) and land cover data ( MCD12Q1 ), which are archived at NASA’s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center ( LP DAAC ). Deer ticks die off in freezing temperatures, but warmer winters in Canada are allowing ticks to establish farther north. The authors used MODIS temperature data to predict suitable deer tick habitat. They did this by looking at average temperature for each day and summing the degrees the average temperature exceeded 0°C over the whole year ( a measurement known as degree days ). Using these calculations of degree days in a year, the authors developed an algorithm to predict tick occurrence. They found that much of central and eastern Canada warmed by 15 to 35 degree days per year, making these areas more habitable to deer ticks. Some places in southern Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec warmed more than 35 degree days per year. Image The authors developed maps of annual Lyme risk in terms of number of adult deer ticks within a square kilometer. The risk maps show that in Quebec province, the average number of deer ticks per square kilometer rose from 56 in the year 2000 to 103 in 2015. In Manitoba province, the number of deer ticks tripled, from 36 per square kilometer to 110. The risk for Lyme disease is highest in southern parts of Canada, which are also more populated. Kotchi found that during 2012, which was an especially hot year, Lyme disease risk in every Canadian province was higher than all of the other years he analyzed. As the climate warms, Lyme disease risk in Canada is expected to increase. “The first cases of Lyme disease in Quebec were in the late 1990s,” said Kotchi. “Lyme has been expanding in Canada ever since.” According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, Lyme disease cases in Canada increased from 144 in 2009 to 992 in 2016. Kotchi’s work is instrumental in helping the Public Health Agency of Canada assess emerging tick populations and communicate Lyme risk to its citizens.

Research Highlights: Carbon—one of the primary building blocks of all organic matter on Earth—is a fundamental part of the Earth system, and it moves through the planet’s atmospheric, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems through a range of biological, chemical, geological, and physical processes known as the carbon cycle . For most people, the movement of carbon through the environment is evident in the lives of plants and animals. Plants grow by converting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), water, and sunlight to biomass (e.g., leaves and stems) and oxygen through photosynthesis. Then, the carbon returns to the atmosphere when the plants decay, are eaten and digested by animals, or burn in fires. The way the carbon cycle is beginning to change due to increased levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere is noticeable, too. For example, warmer temperatures are lengthening the growing seasons of plants, causing them to bloom earlier in the year and thereby altering food supplies for the animals that depend on them. It’s possible, of course, that longer growing seasons may result in more CO 2 being taken out of the atmosphere. On the other hand, if increased warming leads to greater instances of drought and increased plant stress, plant growth may slow, resulting in more carbon being released into the atmosphere and even greater warming. To figure out whether terrestrial vegetation will store more carbon (i.e., be a carbon sink) in the future or release it back into the atmosphere (i.e., be a carbon source), scientists rely on forecasts from ecosystem models infused with data from a range of sources. Their results, however, don’t always agree. “Right now, we don’t know whether terrestrial ecosystems are going to become carbon sources or carbon sinks in the next 100 years, and there is research saying both will happen,” said Dr. Kyla Dahlin, an Associate Professor in Michigan State University’s Department of Geography, Environment, and Spatial Sciences and Program in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior. “Model predictions depend on the particular ecosystem and spatial scale you’re looking at, the model that you’re using, and how you’re accounting for all the various ecosystem components.\" Much of this uncertainty is associated with the inherent complexity of ecosystems themselves, as ecosystem processes are affected by a wide range of variables that can make it difficult to predict how they might change in the future. Yet, some of the uncertainty can be attributed to models as well. “If you look at a lot of different ecosystem models, the [range of] what they’re predicting into the future gets wider and wider,” said Dahlin. “This is driven by the different ways models ‘think’ terrestrial ecosystems work.” To help reduce this uncertainty, Dahlin and her colleagues have been studying how ecosystem variables, such as forest structure and species variability, impact carbon sequestration—information that could be used to improve model predictions of how climate change will impact plants and, more broadly, the entire Earth system. Image This diagram of the fast carbon cycle shows the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and the ocean. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes and red are human contributions in gigatons of carbon per year. White numbers indicate stored carbon.

Credit: Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. “It’s been shown that more heterogeneous and structurally complex forests, even if they’re the same density and overall height, take up more carbon than more homogeneous forests. That suggests we should conserve our older, more heterogenous forests, and it’s something we could potentially manage for,” Dahlin said. “But these results are from a relatively small number of studies, so whether that translates to the global scale we don’t know yet.” Finding out is of the utmost importance. “If terrestrial ecosystems start releasing a lot of carbon into the atmosphere, then that’s a big problem because they’ve really been a big buffer for the past several hundred years against the increased CO 2 that we’ve put into the atmosphere; but if they are actually able to catch up and take up more CO 2 , then that would be great.” Dahlin’s approach to resolving some of these unknowns is to, in her words, “bridge the gap” between localized, small-scale ecological studies and land surface models (which operate at much larger scales) to better understand how ecosystems work within more ecologically relevant boundaries. NASA Earth science data are an integral part of this effort. “A lot of our work involves the use of different remote sensing tools, including airborne tools, so we can really get at that watershed scale,” Dahlin said. “Times series imagery from the Operational Land Imager ( OLI ) instrument aboard [the joint NASA/USGS] Landsat satellites and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) aboard NASA’s Aqua and Terra satellites are also useful.” Time series imagery is particularly beneficial for Dahlin’s work in phenology (i.e., the study of cyclical and seasonal natural phenomena), as it allows her to monitor the seasonal changes in vegetation in ecosystems around the globe. “Different forests have different phenologies, meaning their structure and physiological heterogeneity changes over the course of the season,” she said. “So, depending on the question we’re trying to answer, we look at data from Landsat or MODIS aboard NASA’s Aqua and even the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ( AVHRR ) [which has flown aboard several NOAA satellites]. I’m also using time series imagery in another project designed to help us understand how changes over time have influenced the structure and function of forests in the present.” Dahlin also uses data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer ( AVIRIS ) and the AVIRIS-Next Generation ( AVIRIS-NG ) airborne sensors that have flown on several aircraft, including NASA's ER-2 research plane. These instruments observe changes in light reflected from Earth to obtain accurate, quantitative characterizations of the composition and features of Earth's surface, including vegetation. Dahlin and her colleagues obtain these and other data from several sources, including NASA's Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center ( ORNL DAAC ). Operated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the DAAC is a partnership between NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy, and ingests, processes, archives, and distributes data products pertaining to terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecological dynamics in NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System ( EOSDIS ) collection. For an example of how datasets like those archived at ORNL DAAC and other repositories inform Dahlin’s research, one need only consult a few of Dahlin’s publications, such as a 2020 paper she and her colleagues published in the journal Land . In this publication, Dahlin and her research team presented the results of an experiment in which they compared outputs from a Land Surface Model known as the Community Land Model ( CLM ) with Landsat, MODIS, and ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-2 satellite observations to determine how well the CLM represented several ecological processes within southwestern Michigan’s Kalamazoo watershed. Image This map of the Kalamazoo watershed shows counties in purple with a simplified National Land Cover Database 2011 land cover map as background: gray is developed land, yellow is cultivated land, light green is forest, darker green is wetland, blue is water. Flux tower locations in southern Barry County are marked with a black “x”. Graphic appears courtesy of Dr. Kyla Dahlin. The experiment’s results showed good correlation between the satellite observations and the model’s inputs for annual temperature and precipitation, but significant differences between the satellite data and the model outputs on ecological parameters. “For CLM processes (outputs), seasonal changes in leaf area index (LAI) do not track satellite estimates well, and peak LAI in the CLM is nearly double the satellite record,” the researchers write. “Estimates of greenness and productivity, however, are more similar between the CLM and [the satellite] observations. Summer soil moisture tracks in timing but not magnitude. Land surface reflectance shows significant positive correlations in the winter, but not in the summer.” Based on these findings, Dahlin and her colleagues identified several areas in which the model could be improved, including land cover distribution estimates, phenology algorithms, summertime radiative transfer modelling, and plant stress responses. Such conclusions are important, the researchers note, because these models are often used to inform land use planning; therefore, it’s imperative for decision-makers to be aware of the uncertainty in model outputs. The theme of improving ecological models also surfaced in a paper Dahlin, lead author Dr. Aaron Kamoske, and others published in the journal Ecological Applications in 2021. In this publication, Dahlin and her colleagues evaluate a methodology for conducting within-canopy trait modeling that combines airborne lidar and hyperspectral observations with field-collected data. The study took place on an actively-managed 13,096 acre (5,300 hectare) National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) site within Alabama’s Talladega National Forest. Because the site featured a mosaic of forest types and both coniferous (pine) and deciduous (oak, magnolia, and other) species, it allowed the researchers to assess the impacts of forest structure on spatial patterns of nitrogen and examine the influence of abiotic gradients (i.e., environmental conditions) and management regimes on the percent of nitrogen in the top of a forest canopy and the total amount of nitrogen (measured in grams per square meter of ground) within a forest canopy. “We can fly a plane over [a site], get hyperspectral data, and then take that information and convert it into interesting physiological [parameters], like leaf nitrogen content and leaf mass per area, but [when you do that] you’re really only measuring the top of the canopy and you’re not going all the way through,” said Dahlin. “So, we modeled the leaf density through the canopy using lidar and then developed maps of top-of-canopy leaf nitrogen concentration [from the hyperspectral data] and total canopy leaf nitrogen [from the combined lidar and hyperspectral data].” Image This workflow diagram shows the methodology Dahlin and her colleagues used to conduct within-canopy trait modeling. Leaf area density (LAD, mL2/mG2, mL2 refers to square meters of leaf material, while mG2 refers to square meters of ground); Leaf mass per area (LMA, g/mL2); N, foliar nitrogen content (g N/g leaf); total canopy N, total canopy nitrogen content (g/m2). Field-collected sunlit top-of-canopy percent N and LMA refers to leaf samples that were collected at the top of the canopy, were constantly sunlit, and had no leaves above (i.e., no sun impediment). Field-collected within-canopy percent N and LMA refer to leaf samples that were collected within the canopy (i.e., not constantly sunlit, shaded, and with other leaves surrounding them). Graphic appears courtesy of Kyla Dahlin. Comparison of the maps revealed that, in contrast to top of canopy nitrogen values, the variation of total canopy nitrogen is dampened across this landscape, resulting in relatively homogeneous spatial patterns. At the same time, the researchers found that leaf functional diversity and canopy structural diversity exhibited branching patterns associated with the spatial distribution of plant functional types. This is important, the researchers note, because although forest structural and functional diversity drive critical canopy processes related to carbon sequestration, they are rarely considered together at ecosystem scales. Adopting remote-sensing methodologies like the one Dahlin and her colleagues evaluated in this paper could address that. “What we showed was that all of those differences [in nitrogen values] that you see when you’re just looking at the top of the canopy kind of go away when you sum-up the entire canopy,” Dahlin said. “That’s interesting because, potentially, it means that a lot of the dramatic differences [seen] when comparing two leaves side-by-side may not be that significant when you start thinking about the entire canopy.” Such findings, Dahlin notes, could one day improve scientists’ ability to represent ecological processes like carbon sequestration in landscape, continental, and global models. “We haven’t gotten there yet, but it’s interesting that there have been decades of research on leaf traits but connecting it to whole canopy physiology may not be as direct as originally thought,” she said. “That has potential consequences for how we think forests work.” When that day comes, the ORNL DAAC and the other EOSDIS DAACs will be there to supply ecologists like Dahlin with the data they need to better understand Earth’s terrestrial ecosystems and improve the models helping us to prepare for and respond to the impacts of a changing climate.

The data are for the growing seasons of 2017-2021 for 10-km x 10-km windows centered over 104 eddy covariance towers at AmeriFlux and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. The dataset is derived at 3-m spatial resolution from PlanetScope imagery across a range of plant functional types and climates in North America. These LSP data can be used to assess satellite-based LSP products, to evaluate predictions from land surface models, and to analyze processes controlling the seasonality of ecosystem-scale carbon, water, and energy fluxes. The data are provided in NetCDF format along with geospatial area-of-interest information and visualizations of the analysis window for each site in GeoJSON and HTML formats. Additional ORNL DAAC data holdings on aspects of vegetation, forest structure and cover, and biogeochemistry can be found at the Vegetation and Forests Science Theme Lister. Citation: Moon, M., A.D.

(2022): Global-Gridded Daily Methane Emissions Climatology from Lake Systems, 2003-2015 This dataset provides global gridded information on lake surface area and open water CH4 emissions at a resolution of 0.25-degree x 0.25-degree for an annual climatology representative of the average conditions from 2003 to 2015. A compilation of flux data from 575 individual lake systems and 893 aggregated flux values were used, and each flux measurement was classified into one of seven ecoclimatic types. Ice-cover-regulated emission seasonality was derived from satellite microwave observations of ice cover phenology and freeze-thaw dynamics. Global lake area was determined from the merger of HydroLAKES and Climate Change Initiative Inland-Water (CCI-IW) remote-sensing data, and lakes were classified into ecoclimatic regions to facilitate linking these types with ecosystem-specific CH4 measurements in the flux compilation. Exploratory estimates of fluxes associated with ice melt and with spring and fall water-column turnover are also included. The data are provided in NetCDF format. Additional data on a similar topic and other relevant links can be found on the ORNL DAAC's Climate Collection page. Citation: Johnson, M.S., E. Matthews, D. Bastviken, J. Du, and V. Genovese. 2022.

The dataset was produced with a top-down approach based on fire radiative energy (FRE) and smoke aerosol emission coefficients (Ce) derived from multiple new-generation satellite observations. Specifically, the Ce values of peatland, tropical forest, cropland, or savanna and grassland were derived from fire radiative power (FRP) and emission rates of smoke aerosols based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire and aerosol products. FRE for each 0.1-degree interval was calculated from the diurnal FRP cycle that was reconstructed by fusing cloud-corrected FRP retrievals from the high temporal-resolution (10 mins) Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) with those from high spatial-resolution (375 m) VIIRS. This new dataset was named the Fused AHI-VIIRS based fire Emissions (FAVE). Fire emissions data are provided in comma-separated values (CSV) format with one file per month from July 2015 to December 2020. Each file includes variables of fire observation time, fire geographic location, classification, fire radiative energy, various fire emissions and related standard deviations. The NASA CMS program is designed to make significant contributions in characterizing, quantifying, understanding, and predicting the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks through improved monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes. The System uses NASA satellite observations and modeling/analysis capabilities to establish the accuracy, quantitative uncertainties, and utility of products for supporting national and international policy, regulatory, and management activities. CMS data products are designed to inform near-term policy development and planning.
